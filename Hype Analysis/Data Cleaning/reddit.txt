2018-11-06 15:08:38 Interesting that Thugs of Hindostan has done NO traditional promotions for the film, including interviews, etc - relying almost solely on small videos uploaded to Youtube. I wonder if Zero will go the same way since both are big budget films.

2018-11-10 12:52:23 Is Thugs of Hindostan worth a visit to the cinema?
2018-09-27 13:33:06 It looks dumb, inaccurate, and cheap.And I’m totally going to watch it.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 The South Indian people who hang at r/bollywoodrealism must be crying and shivering.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 I read all comments on the trailer thread. You are only one who liked it.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 Tbh I was obsessed with PotC as a child and seeing the trailer made me really excited and nostalgic!! I agree that Aamir's character seemed interesting, and I'm really excited to see Fatima's character too. 
Also at first I was SO excited at the idea that they were fighting for freedom and "finally a country that suffered with Britain has some pirate representation instead of only white dudes!!" But I'm not Indian and have minimal knowledge about Indian history, so the last thread just taught me that wasn't the case but I'm still excited lol
2018-09-27 13:33:06 "The infinity war trailers had ps2 like cgi"

YRF mein kitni ki intership mili bhai?
2018-09-27 13:33:06 I liked it, it's not a Pirates of Carribbean copy, it's based on an original British era book, the roles are perfect...

Only thing I want from movie is just they don't bollywoodify it too much and keep it close to the book
2018-09-27 13:33:06 I think you have to give a bit of a pass with the VFX since its clearly bollywood's weakness (tiny budgets comparatively), everything else looked pretty interesting.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 I saw it a few times and now I don't hate it !! *Itna bura bhi nai hai*
2018-09-27 13:33:06 You are all alone, my mate.

I agree with your thoughts on Katrina, but to assume that CGI will be "worked on" in the remaining weeks is ludicrous. They usually send out the trailer AFTER the post production is done.

Also - 

>a huge budget which Bollywood will never see 

Do not agree. Bollywood has the monies and the mojo; the skills is lacking.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 I found it ok. Other than initial ship scene, VFX was decent.

This is the era of social media 

If Sholay would've released today, people would've trolled it by saying that Sholay is poor people's Seven Samurai.
2018-09-27 13:33:06 Bhai, I liked it. Mai toh dekhunga. 
2018-09-27 13:33:06 Bhai, main tere sath hu. I liked it. 
2018-09-27 13:33:06 [removed]
2018-09-27 13:33:06 Its just Bollywood Pirates of the Caribbean. 
I’ll watch it. It won’t be good because it would have to be better than Pirates of the Caribbean. And there is a VERY low chance it will be better than any of those movies (based off the trailer it doesn’t look as crisp or funny as POTC).
But I’ll still watch it. 
Also is anyone else seeing Aamir Khan going down the John
ny Depp route of weird characters? Not against it, just a thought.

2018-11-01 08:03:40 This movie looks like Pirates of Carribean reject. I'm sure it will do well in China. The last PoC movie and Aamir Khan movies did very well in China.
2018-11-01 08:03:40 So I'm fairly new to this sub and mostly just lurk but I have a couple questions.     
  
I'm aware that Aamir Khan is pretty big in China but if Aquaman is releasing on the 7th of December (a week before) then would the impact really be that big?   
   
Sure if this releases the week after then it could hurt it's 2nd week but how important is that 2nd week in relation to the 1st?  
  
Edit: Guess I won't be getting an answer from here then.  
  
Edit 2: Oh shit I guess it's not just me then huh.
2018-11-01 08:03:40 Why are all the comments downvoted? Is this sub being brigaded ? /u/4rollingstock? 
2018-11-01 08:03:40 That's a big "may". No date is set yet. Relevant information:

> Gavin Feng says the release date has not been locked yet by E Stars. "It is expected to debut someday before Chinese New Year, which falls in February 2019. It can also get a potential December 2018 release since a lot of local titles have begun to target the lucrative Chinese New Year and summer holidays in recent years, and the blackout period in December for protecting Chinese films has also become shorter. Recently, Film Bureau allowed Warner Bros superhero film Aquaman to open on 7 December, two weeks before its North American rollout. In fact, Aquaman is all set to become the first Hollywood blockbuster to release in December (co-productions like The Great Wall are categorised as local films). I have also learned that the Film Bureau may put one more foreign film on 14 December and the blackout period would officially start from 21 December this year. So Thugs of Hindostan has a chance to see the light of day in December," she said.
2018-11-01 08:03:40 If TOH gets a 14 December Release Date then Aquaman is doomed.

2018-09-18 11:35:38 If someone showed me this and said it's fan made (except the bird part) I would believe him, same with 2.0. Is it that fan made teasers are amazingly well made or the original one's has became worse?
2018-09-18 11:35:38 AB Thugs of Hindostan heh. 
2018-09-18 11:35:38 So, is this movie suppose to be VFX heavy? 
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Yeah, I don't feel good about this. PoTC knockoff? Too early to say but I will be very disappointed in Aamir if that happens. 
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Reminds me of that Talisman teaser of the Vidhu Vinod Chopra film that never happened.
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Damn this is tacky. It started well but fell flat when they showed AB’s cardboard cutout. 

I am still watching this movie, this hasn’t shaken my faith yet 
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Not a big fan of the director's past movies. Hope this one's better
2018-09-18 11:35:38 BC this is not raising any hopes. I seriously am looking forward to this movie
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Disgusting. This is what happens when an Indian watches *Pirates of the Caribbean* and *Game of Thrones*, goes to sleep and has a dream, or a nightmare.
2018-09-18 11:35:38 i can't stand amitabh anymore. he's become such a caricature of himself. disappointed in aamir khan for associating with this withering bag of lost glories 
2018-09-18 11:35:38 I believe in you!
2018-09-18 11:35:38 Wtf!! The music is a 'hindu' version of Azeem O Shan Shehenshah.
2018-11-11 00:30:05 (Edit: this response ended up almost being like an article! Sorry lol)

That's true, it is quite strange.

But what I don't get is that this is one of, if not the, most anticipated films of the year- they can't just think people will forget they were in it if they don't talk about it, like RajKummar Rao did when he didn't promote 5 Weddings.  A movie like that most people not only will forget, but many probably didn't even realize it existed since promotion was almost nonexistent (at least, it seemed like it to me).  But Thugs is on everyone's radar- not only because of its stature but because it's the only film that was released this week.  Practically all the media and entertainment outlets are talking about it these days, naturally.

My guess is that the cast doesn't want to be flooded with negative tweets or deal with the press about the film's failure.  Either that or, if the blinds are to be believed, Aamir took issue with the film and the producers and slowly distanced himself from it (probably after seeing footage and realizing it wouldn't be that good), and the rest of the cast followed suit with him.  This might be why the producers decided to take preemptive measures to ensure maximum box office collections, like: 1) raise ticket prices, 2) give it the widest possible screen release, even internationally 3) pre-sell distribution rights in China (it sold it already and has a 145 crore guarantee from there).  If most critics gave it between 1 to 2 stars, with a few giving it 2.5 or higher, then they might know that it's not worth going to bat for, and they can 'ride out the storm.' 

Aamir can afford to recede- he does that anyway and isn't known for his public life.   Though he himself says that he is nervous before each release and often doesn't sleep - so the reception to this film is probably doing a number on him if he takes it personally.  Bachchan can probably take it in stride, as he is a respected figure and people probably won't bother him too much about it - and he is at an age and stature where he himself may not be too worried about it.

Katrina fortunately has Zero coming up in a month, so her energy will probably be shifted to that now, and the worst she has to do will be to field reporters' questions about Thugs with some previously-thought out responses and quickly move on.  Reporters probably won't hound her much about it since Zero will be the main focus at the time. Given that Zero has much more positive hype (especially with the trailer), she may be riding that wave more quickly.

The one I feel for is Fatima. This is only her second film, and she was really riding with/depending on Aamir for its success.  By all accounts, this film was meant to be a 'guaranteed success' as it had all the right ingredients- but amazingly it has turned out unsuccessful.  I can only imagine what she must be thinking.  Many critics actually liked her performance but it doesn't help when the character is largely overshadowed by Khan/Bachchan.
 
Interestingly, both her and her Dangal co-star Sanya Malhotra have had their second feature films releasing within a month of each other.  Sanya's (Badhaai Ho) was by far the riskier one- it had a smaller budget, was an ensemble cast (those are often hit-or-miss), an up-and-coming lead in Ayushmann Khurrana (arguably still not a guaranteed draw like a Varun Dhawan), and had a taboo-topic theme that wasn't guaranteed to draw people (old-age pregnancy).  Yet despite all these factors, amazingly it worked - since the story was so well done.  Theirs is one of the great successes of 2018 and it will almost guarantee Sanya more acting prospects, and is cementing Ayushmann as a dependable smaller-budget star.

Fatima had, on paper, a far 'safer' film - she had Aamir Khan to depend on, who people loved - and Amitabh Bachchan, who people have loved but for even longer!  Plus there was Katrina Kaif, the go-to actress for female physicality in a film. That 3-star cocktail alone would be enough to guarantee audience footfalls. YRF, the biggest production house in the country, was bankrolling the film, and they would be making a cool pirate movie- unseen or unheard of in India- on a scale that people had never imagined.  They would be even building two huge ships for authenticity. It was clear that the producers were going all-out for this film (300 crores!); who WOULDN'T want to be a part of this? It's like making history. (I imagine this is what Aamir also may have thought, to draw him to the film - the fact that it has such high potential).  

But somebody dropped the ball - probably the director, producer, we don't know.  And now what was supposed to be a moment of pride has turned collossally sour.  That also makes it THAT much harder to distance yourself from it- the public had such high expectations for it, that they won't forget it anytime soon.  So for Fatima, she is in an unexpected position because when success seemed all but certain, and you were riding on the shoulders of a 'guaranteed success' mentor, when your film fails it probably feels like the rug is pulled from beneath you.  The question for her is, where does she go next?  There is always the chance Aamir can help her further, maybe casting her in the Mahabharata series he is supposedly working on (as what Rajeev Masand recently wrote about), but she may have trouble getting acting jobs because it won't be easy to say "Thugs of Hindostan" to people and expect them not to have a bad aftertaste about it now. 
2018-11-11 00:30:05 >Kat probably knew she was in 2.5 scenes, so she didn’t bother. 

 hahaha Lmao, Savage. Bai, sometimes you really drop the mike. 
2018-11-11 00:30:05 Yes, there are some other films that are coming with no promotion but thats a financial issue, the films are good! But in this case they had so much money- But oh well, TOH I dont even wanna think abt #PTSD

2018-11-11 07:47:21 Mr. President, please focus on your mid-terms.
2018-11-11 07:47:21 I think word of mouth on this one is so bad, that YRF will have to compensate distributorsat their own cost!!

Does anyone foresee YRF shutting shops due to this? How is their pipeline?
