2018-10-06 08:33:39 Dude I laughed so much during the chase scene. I live where they filmed and they looped around the same block like 6 times 
2018-10-05 07:03:48 “I’m kind of a loser too back on my planet”

So as long as the other symbiotes do not come to earth, he’s the strongest guy here huh

Best reason to protect earth ever
2018-10-06 11:20:29 This is one of those movies where if the reviews praised it I would've called it trash, but since the reviews trashed it I thought it was decent, that attitute going in
2018-10-05 06:53:29 I liked when he got in the lobster tank 
2018-10-06 02:50:33 I love how chill everyone is after seeing Venom casually devour people.
2018-10-08 23:19:49 Dr. Dan was a real cool guy. They could have made a douche but they went in the right direction.
2018-10-06 11:23:19 When Drake said to just send him to space by himself and they zoomed in on the worker behind him shaking his head in confusion, The Office theme song started playing in my head and I absolutely lost it in the theatre
2018-10-05 17:27:54 The best part of the movie was when the voice called Hardy a "pussy"
2018-10-05 07:55:04 That little girl never got to ask her question though. Drake just gave her a pin and peaced-out
2018-10-05 06:04:15 That old Malaysian woman took 6 months to reach the airport.
2018-10-05 07:21:44 Drake - "Yeah, let's make these expensive ass drones to kill our targets, that'll be way more effective than catching them on foot."

Engineer - "Cool, so should we like put a gun or a taser on top? That'll be a quick way to subdue fleeing targets, while also keeping the expensive drones a safe distance away."

Drake - "lol fuck that, make them blow up"
2018-10-05 20:02:04 She-Venom was fine ;)
2018-10-05 17:57:12 My favorite scene in the movie is during Carlton Drake’s presentation to the kids, where the little girl tries to ask a question, gets shushed by her classmates, and Drake proceeds to give a big speech about how asking questions and being inquisitive are positive attributes, and then she NEVER gets to ask her question.

2018-10-07 19:50:15 Tom Hardy was so good in this. 
2018-10-05 22:53:00 Note to Venom: don't tell people you barely know all of your fatal vulnerabilities in casual conversation.
2018-10-05 06:35:51 Venom is essentially a lonely alien that went to outer space to find a friend :(
2018-10-05 06:06:16 I liked the surprise cameo by Woody Harrelson as Carrot Top
2018-10-05 06:26:26 show me the end of the movie in a trailer one more fucking time
2018-10-05 06:15:59 Yo. That scene where Lady Venom kissed Brock got me going, no lie. 
2018-10-05 08:30:09 At my screening the entire theatre erupted with laughter when Venom said “pussy”. 
2018-10-05 23:24:46 They used a Wilhelm scream in this movie 🤔
2018-10-07 18:16:49 There were just so many little things in the movie that killed it for me. Tom Hardy was great, of course. But like...

- I like how this random little girl slips into the research facility at like...midnight. And this dude's reaction is "Oh nooo are you lost?" I feel like a more natural reaction would be like: "Wtf how did you get in here?!"

- I mentioned this elsewhere on the thread; but for a super mega stealthy reporter his means of questioning someone was really weird. And the fact that he freaking left the camera sound on while he was sneaking around. 

- They really had no idea how to write this love story. All the scenes for them were easily the worst. 

- Why are you advertising this as an "NO MORE SUPERHEROES/GOOD GUYS" film if he's just going to be a good guy in the end?

- I feel like that one henchman would have been a great set up for Carnage. More so then showing a random new character at the end. The Henchman dude kept saying really violent, out of place things to Brock. He just seemed like a dude who was jonesing to kill someone. I feel he could have been set up as Carnage, you know? 

Over all, I had fun. It was a nice E.T. reboot. 
2018-10-06 20:15:42 I think the biggest tell that the movie was edited to bits to get a PG13 rating was the rabbit scene. Its the first scene I think where we see a symbiote interact with another life form. And instead of seeing it, we cut to a shitty computer model of whats happening.

Like wtf was that? 
2018-10-05 06:14:00 He doesn't miss you.

Cause he's a cat.
2018-10-05 06:15:30 That symbiote vs symbiote fight at the end was a mess to watch but boy did it look expensive.  
2018-10-05 08:02:28 I just find it hilarious that Venom's motivation for sticking around and saving humanity is "Well I'm a loser on symbiote world but here I can be the coolest kid on the block".  

Like just the thought that the symbiotes have a social pecking order of their own.
2018-10-09 02:09:30 Gotta admit when the swat team cornered him, and they put on their masks, and the sequence of Brock saying "Mask" and Venom saying "copy" followed by the transformation, one of the bigger nerdboner moments in films lately.
2018-10-06 21:09:27 Sony: Hey Eminem, can you make a song for our new movie Venom?

Eminem: **venoMMMMMMMMMM venoMMMMMMMMM venoMMMMMMMMMMMMM**
2018-10-07 21:09:46 Venom is a romcom. Between Venom and Eddie. 

10/10 will watch again. 
2018-10-05 06:55:29 That wig on Woody looked terrible man...
2018-10-05 08:35:19 Venom: Careful! He's got shit you've never seen before!

*pulls out some knives*
2018-10-05 17:02:52 The most frustrating thing about this is Venom on the big screen actually works (visually sans final fight scene). Now, just get a solid director, solid script, and actually show some violence rather than cutting away every time someone is iced. In the proper hands, this has potential to be dope (so long as they replace the wig in post credit)
2018-10-07 19:33:32 My face when Venom turned out to be a better buddy cop flick than The Happy Time Murders. 
2018-10-05 06:07:27 When he took the elevator instead of jumping off the building, the symbiote said "pussy", that good a good laugh out of the theater 
2018-10-05 06:04:40 You're trash brock. 
2018-10-06 18:01:34 I never realized I needed Venom Bro in my life
2018-10-08 04:58:58 I think my brother summed Drake up best "It sounds like he is always giving a Ted talk"
2018-10-05 07:51:19 So glad they changed the way they pronounced “symbiote” from the trailers 
2018-10-05 16:12:35 I went to see it on Wednesday and tbh it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't great either but not as bad as I thought it would be.  I just don't know what Hardy's accent is supposed to be.  It makes the character sound simple.
2018-10-05 06:08:13 Anyone else notice in the credits that the astronaut who died was named "JJ Jameson II" ?

Edit: too many I's
2018-10-07 09:27:51 Seeing the female Venom had me feeling some kind of way
2018-10-06 06:15:12 Why was the She-Venom so T H I C C
2018-10-06 15:40:45 Textbook popcorn movie, IMO. It's reasonably fun and has a fair few enjoyable action scenes, but the Eddie/Venom banter pretty much carries the film. It's not winning any awards, but it's at least worth the ticket price.
2018-10-05 08:08:57 So that old Asian lady symbiote took six months to get to the airport?
2018-10-05 08:16:33 The first act felt slow yet somehow rushed at the same time. Engaged and employed to single and jobless within 10 minutes.  

Riz Ahmed should have grown a moustache so he could twirl it with every monologue he delivered.

It was a pretty average movie but Tom Hardy gave a good performance and the action scenes demonstrated Venom's abilities well.  

The symbiote that escaped the Doctor with a conscience was never found but maybe that's the one that'll find Kassidy. Harrelson is a good choice there I think.
2018-10-05 06:44:56 One bold choice I felt this movie made was giving the villain's act 3 goal be as simple as "get inside the space ship I privately own and leave the planet". Normally a climactic villain's struggle versus the heroes should be a battle of wills and or ideologies. Here Venom just kind of got in Riot's way because off-screen he came to enjoy humans and Eddie and Riot wanted to leave right there and then because--- \*\*checks notes\*\* Drake believes there's only a generation left of life on Earth and the Symboite wants to consume the humans?

Wait. Both Riot and Drake want to evacuate their home planets for lack of resources and their conclusion is to go to the other? Something seems off here.

Did like that Riot's reaction to Venom's arrival was a fairly reasonable (to paraphrase) "Oh it's this fucking guy--- okay, get in the ship. We're leaving" before the fighting.
2018-10-05 06:15:10 >turning him into The Mask

SSSSSSMOKIN!
2018-10-05 08:20:08 I was half expecting him to see SpiderMan footage on YouTube and decide to grow a spider on his chest. 
2018-10-05 07:57:13 If Marvel ever does Venom in the MCU, I really hope they bring back Hardy. Say what you want about the film, but I honestly feel like he may be one of the only actors to pull off the dual relationship as well as he did especially when he played both Brock and did the voice for Venom. Venom and Brock are still like two different people. Their relationship was the best part of the movie. He played off himself so well. 
2018-10-05 06:54:02 They threw a Superman reference in there but strayed so far away from even remotely acknowledging any Marvel property. 
2018-10-06 10:58:39 That was... better than I expected. I was expecting a flaming trainwreck but got a solid superhero(?) film with some great action. The dialogue between Venom and Eddie had me in stitches at certain points. Definitely worth a rewatch in my opinion. The only complaint that jumps out at me is that I would have liked to see more development between Venom and Riot, and the performances aside from Tom Hardy weren't that great. I appreciate the fact that it broke free from typical Marvel constraints and tropes, even if Venom's heel/face turn wasn't really explained that well. I can understand why critics are savaging it, but I found it to be ridiculously fun. 

  On a side note, it's probably the closest we're going to get a Prototype film. The fight scene with the SWAT team felt like watching James Heller, and Riot's blade arms immediately reminded me of Alex Mercer. As a huge fan of Prototype, the action scenes actually had me smiling ear to ear.

  EDIT: Some of the scenes definitely gave me big The Darkness vibes as well. Damn, this movie really scratched my itch for unlikely video game adaptations I really want. Venom was even weak to flashbangs, just like Jackie (although Jackie was allergic to the light, not the noise).
2018-10-06 12:59:11 The consensus seems to be that Tom Hardy is the only redeeming quality of this film which is fine considering he’s in nearly every scene. I enjoyed it a lot. 
2018-10-07 15:04:26 Did anyone else think it was kind of weird that Eddie Brock is meant to be this fairly well-built guy (noticeably not muscular or hulking, just fitter than the average guy) who has dumbbells in his apartment, but the only food he seems to have at home is tater tots?

A man after my own heart for sure, but I just thought that was kind of strange.
2018-10-07 16:19:56 I don't think I've ever rolled my eyes harder at a movie than at the line "When I get out of here, there's gonna be *carnage*".

Like goddamn, all they had to do was have the Venom VO say something about how he doesn't feel right on the drive up to the prison, then have the guard say something about how "Cletus/Kassidy doesn't just talk to people" or have Eddie say "the FBI want me to interview Cletus/Kassidy to see if he will tell us where bodies are" or whatever, and then show as they're talking the Venom symbiote wigging out on his back (maybe even have it "sneeze" as a VO), and a small red symbiote falls off and makes his way to Kassidy.

Instead we got Woody Harrelson obviously wearing a 5$ Party-City wig, saying the most obvious and on the nose dialog.  Good lord.

Rest of the movie was pretty average.  Had some good scenes here and there, ton of dead weight scenes that they could have cut.  Also naming the main lab tech doctor lady "Doctor Skirts" seemed oddly sexist.  I know it was like "Skhirth" or something, but all I could hear anytime they said her name was "Doctor Skirts"

Venom constantly talking shit to Eddie was hilarious though.  Calling him a pussy for not jumping out the window, calling him a loser like 4 different times, mocking him for his relationship with Annie...it was pretty glorious.
2018-10-11 04:53:12 Anne in the venom suit was pretty cool. Her suit looked exactly like the one from the comic, tall, slender and terrifying. 
2018-10-13 22:22:35 Absolutely nowhere near as bad as people make this out. It is rushed and it seems to be parts missing but the Tom Hardy and Venom dynamic carried this movie and it was literally why we went to see it.
2018-10-17 04:36:48 Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but am I the only one who thought it was really short and extremely rushed? I mean the actual bad guy plot part of the movie literally only lasted 5 minutes and the rest of it was exposition.
2018-10-05 07:47:52 I was really skeptical but I had a lot of fun... after the incredibly slow first 30-40 minutes. 

As others have mentioned the final fight scene between two dark colored characters in the dark was a mess and I honestly had kind of a hard time following. 

But despite it’s flaws it had some charm and I’m curious to see where they take it next. 

Oh, and that Into The SpiderVerse sequence at the end was really fucking cool. Excited for that flick. 
2018-10-05 06:45:05 The only good part of this film was the chemistry Tom Hardy had with himself. The rest of the film was all too predictable, the action scene at the climax was visually confusing, and the violence of the film felt like it was really clashing with the actual story/tone of the rest of the film.
2018-10-05 07:12:30 Didnt care for the story, villain, supporting characters, and pretty much everything that wasn't  Brock/Venom. The action was cool and the dialogue between Brock and Venom was good. Tom Hardy was great as always.

They got the main character right I think, but boy did that story need some work.
2018-10-06 19:16:57 The film at bit's of really great ideas and actions draped over the more tired formula.  It really does feel like something that would have come out in 2005.

One bit I thought was interesting was when the villain gets infected, he see's a lost little girl in a super secret lab, he's alone and not putting on a facade. Yet his reaction is legitimately to be  kind and concerned about little girl.  Like maybe he truly see's his motives as altruistic.

It's just to bad that rest of the time he's vindictive prick or mustache twirling evil.
2018-10-10 19:04:37 Venom was the closest I've come to feeling like I did when I was a kid and my parents would regularly rent box office flops, and I'd sit there, laughing and enraptured the entire time. Cutthroat Island, Con Air, Waterworld. Just you and a bunch of people laughing at lines that weren't supposed to be funny, and yet obviously were because the editor cut them that way on purpose. The noise Eddie made in the lobster tank before the smash cut had half the theater in stitches for a minute straight. And oh my god, Hardy's performance. Eddie was weird and awkward and fun, and he and Venom were fun. I wish we could have seen what was cut, but making the movie longer would have been a terrible choice.

Yes, it wasn't very good objectively and yes, it should have been R-rated. But I still laughed more than I have in ages at a movie. And what the PG-13 version of Con Air was for my family, the PG-13 version of Venom will be for some weird 13 year old who'll discover how much fun a bad movie can be. 
2018-10-16 14:34:50 The movie's got a lot of problems but really, it was fun. It's easy to see why critics didn't take to it. Sony haven't even tried to do anything new or bold in terms of the storytelling, they've given up on that front for a while now. Critics be damned they're making movies for the masses and Venom is a movie that's great for a night out with the squad. 

To cover some negatives and then the positives, the movie has an alright plot but a really poor structure and execution. The entire set up of Eddie's character is soo textbook bland, it's astounding really. They essentially tick things off a checklist, spending a few minutes showing how Eddie is a successful interviewer who loves his job and how beautiful Eddie and Anne are together, then the interview incident is followed by a quick firing and break up scene, with an almost clinical efficiency, setting him up for the helplessness that will unite him with Venom soon to come. It isn't that these story choices and interweaving dialogue are wrong, just their textbook replication is head scratching. 

Also, the movie begins with a clear slant toward a more horror oriented narrative. The beautiful deep blacks, blues and oranges that make up the visual palette are perfect for channeling this atmosphere. Funnily enough it retains this ominous foreboding nature right up until the introduction of Venom. And from then it ups it's campiness and the humour has a ferocious uptick that comes out of nowhere. Perhaps this tonal mismatch WAS the point, to suggest that Venom is not this ruthless, vile and sickening creature as we'd thought, but instead a "loser" like our man Eddie Brock. 

The score is intense and rousing, and there's a noticeable difference between how the MCU incorporate music into the action and how Venom does. The loud score, imo is used too generously to become natural to the movie, instead just converting the kinetic action scenes into noisier kinetic action scenes. 

And the villain? They really didn't pay much attention to his character beside a few token monologues about how humanity is a problem(they also made sure to include the scene where two people on opposite sides of a glass barrier press their superimposed hands against it, to "connect" in that oh so classic fashion), showing him being nasty to literally everyone. They definitely didn't want to make this a remotely moral conflict by any metric. 

And coming to moral conflict, Venom we know is an anti-hero, sometimes veering into straight up villain, and I didn't think they justified how Eddie was a good match for Venom on that front. Early in the movie we see Investigative Reporter Eddie and how he is all about busting large corporate bigwigs, strongly suggesting he's a real good guy. The one moment he gets sketchy is when he unethically peers into Anne's laptop and learns confidential information. We also see Eddie being kind to  everybody he meets, from the shopkeeper to the beggar to his ex gf's new boyfriend. Even to that little shit of a neighbor of his. Does this suggest that Eddie is the timid, good natured foil to Venom's unflinching ferocity? Eddie's yin to Venom's yang? Conceptually it might, but it clearly doesn't translate into their fused character. Eddie constantly has to keep Venom check and Venom has to forego all his primal urges at Eddie's reprimand. There is a fundamental conflict here that leaves this any thing but a "good match". This is important because it's not like Eddie's physically skillful; he is a just a reporter. Imo Eddie's and Venom's weak moral compass and uncertainty between good and bad could have served as a strong bond behind their symbiosis and explain why Venom chooses Eddie specifically; it's easier to convince Eddie to do something wrong than with most other people. This again ties to the entire appeal of this character. The reason Venom seemed an interesting idea to build a film around was because of his grey nature, always ever so close to being an unhinged man eating monster, requiring conscious deliberate effort to be kept in check. The version we get is one that is policed by Eddie and realised by the alien Venom(who is anyways an almost cute character with a disarming sense of humour). 

Put simply, if we see our titular character do something bad, we know it's Venom doing the thing with Eddie holding back. It would have been significantly more fascinating if we weren't able delineate their actions in this manner, essentially having to constantly question this character's motives and morals. 

Now all this might sound like one too many negatives for someone to have enjoyed the movie, but the movie did win me over given that I went in with very low expectations. I do not recall ever having seen Tom Hardy play such a nice guy role as Eddie Brock before, and he really, truly, completely CARRIES this film. Taking it from the horror, suspenseful beginning to the buddy comedy of an ending, he is the life blood of the movie. The action sequences were eye-catching. And Venom, for all my qualms over him being reduced to a cuddly wisecracking character, his ridiculous antics and comments really mold the movie into an entertaining blockbuster. The sheer dissonance between the expectation and reality made Venom winningly funny. It's essentially cruel how the most endearing scene in the movie is Eddie laying ground rules to Venom, making you wish for a few more moments with this precise bickering between these two, only for the movie to immediately end. 

A sequel with Woody Harrelson as Carnage promises to be more roundly better. Not least because Carnage with Harrelson will probably be better developed and acted to perfection. And it looks like we'll get that sequel.

Thank you for reading

2018-10-05 06:43:12 Best romance movie of the year. But seriously, the movie would have been so much better if it focused entirely on the eddy/venom dynamic without any of the dumbass generic evil corporation plot line. Which for some reason has an entire military force and yet has basically 0 security guarding their super secret alien experiments. 
2018-10-06 15:46:12 This movie has all the ingredients to be a train wreck. The dialogue is horrendous. Character motivations are one-demensional at best. Zero chemistry between the two human leads. Plot holes galore. A lack of understanding of the source material. Countless eye-rolling stupid & cringey scenes. Sony pulling an Amazing Spider-man 2 with the marketing by showing the closing scene/final shot in the trailer. The most completely unearned and half-baked character development I have ever seen.......


 

But yet I still found myself enjoying my time with this movie. it is by no means a good movie by any stretch of the word. Hell its not even decent, but I still had fun with it. My only fear is that Sony is gonna see the audience reaction, get a big head and go on with their other planned spider-man less films like Morbius, Black Cat, & Silver Sable. I feel like the got lucky with this one, but won't be so lucky next time. 
2018-10-05 08:08:11 That little girl didn't actually get to ask her question even though the CEO (forgot his name) said she should not be silenced lol.
2018-10-05 06:09:06 [I just Learned that Venom and A Star Is Born shared the same DP, Matthew Libatique.](https://twitter.com/neonwhite900/status/1047335196096258049)
2018-10-05 20:39:40 It was better than I expected, but still not good. Would've been a hit in 2003.
2018-10-05 06:07:04 Just saw it tonight....

Was expecting the worst of the worst, but honestly...it was decent.

The action parts with venom were pretty cool. Tom hardy nailed the part of eddie. Venoms voice and humor was very fitting.

It had a few problems with transitions and pacing. Almost every scene with his ex girlfriend was a total mess and did not fit very well.
2018-10-05 23:09:08 This was by no means a great movie, but I enjoyed it. I went in with pretty low expectations so I enjoyed the campiness and Hardy’s performance. 

Also it took the old woman six months to walk from Malaysia to San Francisco. 
2018-10-07 05:56:28 Okay first things first, the pacing was fucking terrible, but I feel like there was a half decent movie buried in there somewhere. I dont see how they can do Carnage justice though. Riot was 1/10th of what Carnage should be, and Venom wasn't an even match at all. Carnage required Venom and Spider-Man to team up to be taken down. I feel like the Carnage we get would be just as underhwelming. 

Also, I don't buy for a second it was never supposed to be R. Sony just chickened out becuase the movie would never have legs with an R AND bad reviews. If theres an extended version, hard R, I think it could easily make this movie much better. 
2018-10-13 19:58:58 I didn't expect anything from this movie and while the story is rather predictable and simple i thought it was actually a fun movie with great action scenes and a lot of superb humor. The major flaw is it should have been R rated. Did the scene with the swat team remind anyone else of Terminator 2?
2018-10-13 22:35:35 At the beginning of the movie, Eddie tells his girlfriend that he loves it when she wears the suit. Then later on in the movie she wears the venom suit. r/shittymoviedetails
2018-10-22 12:58:17 So did Eddie not have a data plan or access to wifi because why did he have to physically show those photos of the lab instead of emailing them?
2018-10-05 21:19:36 Carnage needs to be rated R.
2018-10-05 07:28:17 I really hope they make a sequel. I'm really looking forward to the showdown between Venom and Sideshow Bob.
2018-10-05 06:17:13 Have no intention to see this, all I want to know is if the turd in the wind line stayed or did they say shit instead?
2018-10-05 06:40:58 The character development of Eddie Brock in the beginning is so forced and uncreative but once Venom parts kick in the movie becomes fun and wacky (despite the way too dark fight scenes).

It's also hilarious how Riz Ahmed's character just goes insane without any buildup. Pretty sure some of those 40 minutes that were cut would've helped the movie in some way.
2018-10-06 02:50:07 At the end of my screening we got a preview of Into the Spiderverse. For a split second I thought they were actually putting Venom in it.
2018-10-07 12:45:29 "HOSPITAL. NOW."

wait what
2018-10-10 14:56:57 What is everyone on about this being so terrible? An R rating would have improved things, but other than that i thought it was decent. I don't get to see many movies at a theatre, I don't regret going for this. I enjoyed it more than AntMan. 
2018-10-17 03:04:15 Really liked it - as a comedy. Dark and silly, punchy and then easy to mock too, leans in to action and thriller without ever fully tipping in... I heard it was absolute garbage, so I went in expecting garbage, but instead I just had fun for a couple hours. I do get why it's being panned - the trailer advertises not just a different movie but essentially the complete opposite of what we got. The trailer makes this look like a horror. But then I look at bits like Venom calling Eddie a pussy or stomping around doing a Little-Shop-of-Horrors style "FEED ME! FEED ME!" and question how it wasn't pitched as a comedy to start with. 

If we had this exact same movie but it had been pitched differently I think the reaction would be much more positive, and if they added on that it wasn't the character of Venom they were messing around with, the reaction would be WAY more positive. Oh well. Excited to have Woody Harrelson in Marvel.
2018-10-23 01:51:35 I liked it and thought it was good
2018-10-06 00:43:38 God this movie was all over the place, but i liked it. I wanna see the extra 40 minutes they cut out. It would probably explain like half of questions and this people refered to but was never explained 

2018-10-06 05:52:31 The movie is not perfect, but it was definitely enjoyable. Good fight, good CGI. I loved the development between Eddie and Venom. 
Glad I watched it despite of the hate it got
2018-10-10 20:10:46 The movie worked for the most part, really odd yet fun, but I can pinpoint the precise moment the plot thread was unraveled: "Well, Eddie, I was sort of a loser on my planet too. You know what, screw it, I hate those other symbiotes anyway. I want to stay on earth and be an antihero. Well, I'll let you be the hero, as long as I get to occasionally eat people." Everything the film had going for it was flipped on it's head at that point. I was able to laugh it off and just enjoy the ride. That unintentional campiness actually contributed to the movie for me, in a strange way. 
2018-10-20 05:47:30 Dude, an MRI doesn't use sound waves.
2018-10-05 06:09:33 The movie itself was ok. Tom Hardy was great, though.


2018-10-06 09:21:36 The redeeming quality of the movie, and actually made it enjoyable for me, was Tom Hardy nailing it as Eddie Brock and his interactions with Venom. 
2018-10-10 10:32:14 This was much better than I was expecting based on reviews.

Little slow to start, sure, but overall a pretty decent superhero movie, especially with such a dark "hero".

Right now on RT it's still scoring a little below The Predator, which is silly, because Venom had some serious redeeming qualities, but The Predator was basically garbage all around.
2018-10-11 05:18:59 I enjoyed it but honestly, I am getting a little tired of "CGI fight at night." Especially with characters like Venom and Riot (spoilers?) who are both pretty dark. Like, a black and dark grey fight at night is...besides boring just a bit hard to see
2018-10-21 05:14:54 just got out of the theater. paced really weirdly, disjointed as hell, hardy’s accent was subpar, and the ending was super abrupt and strange but *damn* if i didn’t have fun. 

really wish it was R though, definitely could have done with some more gore. hopefully we’ll get an extended cut with the 40(?) mins that hardy said were cut out. 
2018-10-06 14:02:18 The low review ratings tempered my expectations and the movie pleasantly surprised me. Found my self laughing more than I thought I would be, never really had a dull moment where I thought get on with it.

Sad that they went with PG-13, and the main villain was to bland.
2018-10-09 02:07:15 Who else here thought the wig on Woody Harrelson was pretty funny? 
2018-10-12 09:48:47 I hope they make a sequel. The movie was just fun.
2018-10-05 06:24:35 This movie is not very good, but I really enjoyed it.

The movie sort of becomes a buddy comedy at the 45 minute mark, and then just leans in to that for the rest of the move. Same story beats as any other buddy comedy origin arc: They meet, the don’t get alone, the connect a bit, then they admit they like each other.

My biggest criticisms are these:

1.	It takes WAY too long to get to the actual movie. After I saw it, I thought about how I would have cut it. Eddie’s life falling apart should have just been a cut from Eddie being thrown out of the Life building and then a “3 months later” title card, then cut to Eddie living in a dump, by himself, with little visual clues about what happened. The audience can put it together.
2.	Eddie + Venom together is great stuff. More banter would be welcome. More of them adjusting to each other would be nice.
3.	Eddie is a journalist but seems to have ZERO questions about the alien parasite living inside of him. Where is it from, what does it want, why did it *choose* him. These questions get answered, but only later on.
4.	Riz Ahmed could have been more evil. Eddie has a feeling about him, but to the audience, that’s based on nothing prior to the laptop scene.
2018-10-16 07:54:24 People keep asking me if I saw Venom yet, and what I thought of it. And I've been telling them all the same thing.

I see why critics hate it, and I see why fans like it. Critics hate it because the pacing is awful, the dialogue and plot is dodgy, and the cinematography is standard shitty modern action movie schlock. It takes about half the films duration to get going, and when it does, it's basically over. I found myself repeatedly being like "Wait, is this the final fight?" during the Venom/Riot battle and was disappointed when I finally conceded that it was. Carlton's dialogue had no weight or meat to it at all, and didn't really serve to make him very intimidating (despite Riz Ahmed's commendable attempts). And I agree with Stuckmann's point about placing Venom, an almost entirely black character against a lot of dark backgrounds. Didn't really serve to point out how pretty decently he was visually portrayed.

Now on the other hand, I think fans like it because, as a portrayal of Venom in a film, this really is enjoyable. The highlight of the film is undoubtedly Venom's portrayal and his dialogue with Eddie. In that same vain, Tom Hardy's job as Eddie is enjoyable, and his accent wasn't as hard to handle as I thought it was going to be from the trailers. While I do wish there was more in the film showing interactions between Venom and Eddie (again, due to the pacing of the film), there at the very least did feel like enough to satisfy and actually pull me into their relationship enough to want to see more. Thank god it wasn't as bad as Spiderman 3 where we literally only had one scene of full-face Venom and virtually no actual Symbiote dialogue. That shit pissed me off even when I was a kid and I didn't even know at the time that I was pissed off about that.

Would I see it again, honestly, yeah probably. If friends wanted to go or someone were to put it on around me, yeah I wouldn't mind watching it again, and I do genuinely hope we get to see a sequel. I feel like this attempt wasn't so botched that a second try, if they learn from what went wrong with this attempt, couldn't turn out to be a really enjoyable and well reviewed film, especially since it would inevitably feature more of exactly what made this film tolerable, which is Venom and Eddie's interaction. 
2018-10-05 06:23:09 Just watch Upgrade instead
2018-10-05 13:56:25 My god the baddies in this film were really god damn stupid and incompetent.

So they have the symbiote on the loose and Drake sends his henchmen to recapture it with ***guns*** instead of say, a haz-mat team. What was their plan? How were they gonna contain it? Perhaps they'd have brought some equipment capable of high frequencies over guns, or even just a god damn container.

But okay, I will be forgiving in that they just didn't know what the symbiote was capable of but after getting an ass-whooping and seeing that bullets were ineffective against it what do they do? They go back for round 2 with more guns and explosives. 

Then when they bump into Brock at the hospital they shoot him with a sedative? Really? How convenient for them that at that very moment he was separated from Venom because they would have gotten beaten down again or killed for sure.
2018-10-14 05:36:36 Went in with zero to low expectations. (Purposefully didn't watch the trailer and have no prior knowledge of venom besides vague memories of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man 3, heard of the bad reviews but tried not to put too much stock into it). 

It was a lot funnier than I thought it would be. I was under the impression that it would be really dark and gritty. But it ended up being a lot of fun. 

The scene where Dr Skirth brought Eddie in was a bit silly though. Like were there no cameras at all?? Are you telling me there was only 1 guard on patrol at night? I was surprised Eddie wasn't caught the minute they entered the building. 

Also again when Drake was talking to Dr Skirth in the room with the symbiote. I was a bit like girl, why on EARTH are you telling him about Eddie in that room. Why are you telling him at allll....

I liked how genuinely nice Annie and Dan were. Dan especially, was genuinely concerned for Eddie's health, which was nice. I was apprehensively waiting for a scene where Eddie misused his venom abilities to try to win Annie back and was happy that it didn't happen. Speaking of Annie, her hair looked super wig like which threw me off of her a bit. 

The star of the movie was the Eddie and Venom interactions. For me it was what made the movie so much fun. 

The Carnage part was a bit of a miss for me just cos Woody Harrelson's curly red hair made him seem more wacky than scarily insane.

Won't mind watching the movie again. 
2018-10-05 09:33:28 Anybody else catch the "Only astronaut to survive is Jameson" reference? 
2018-10-05 17:20:30 Did anyone catch the Jameson easter egg? He was the astronaut in the beginning that Riot was bonded to and he doesn't appear on the deceased list later in the movie. JJJ's son!
2018-10-07 05:19:40 I thought the pacing wasn’t all that great towards the end and venom was just a tad too comedic at times but I liked the action and dialogue between Brock and venom. I’d give it a 7-8/10 and I recommend seeing it in theaters.

“Jump”

2018-10-07 11:04:49 [deleted]
2018-10-07 10:07:54 I feel like a few tweaks in the story would make a world of difference:

>Have the space ship crash somewhere in NA

>Have the escaped symbiote be venom

>Have Eddie try and stop the gang member and get shot in the process

>Maybe due to Venom's own bad luck, he's dying in the same area of San Francisco

>Have Venom and Eddie join for a symbiotic relationship, where venom heals Eddie's gun shot wound and eddie provides a stable host for venom

>Have the bad guy (already forgot his name) get infected by one of the captured symbiotes as a result of his own hubris


Everything else is the same, character-wise at least, even though it wasn't great.
2018-10-12 05:29:12 I wasn't going to stay for the post credit scene, but then a crazy Eminem song about Venom came on, and I was stuck. Then Woody Harrelson came out of nowhere and blew all the red headed hairs off my body.  
2018-10-13 18:32:03 I love the Venom/Eddie Brock interactions, but the overall story felt so rushed. Some of the dialogues felt so unnatural too. I would still watch a sequel though. Hopefully they use the box office success from this and build on it.

I still have hopes for a connection with the Spider-Man universe too somehow, but I also don't mind if it never happens.
2018-10-05 19:19:16 I prepared for the worst going to the theatre but it turned out okay. It was neither a great film nor a terrible one but my boyfriend and I were entertained. I was slightly upset that Venom is not as ruthless compared to his comic counterpart. My boyfriend who never read any Spider-Man comics enjoyed Venom though. 

The plot is very weak and the main villain, Riot only appeared in the last 15 minutes. His evil plan was only brought to attention to the viewers towards the end so it seemed very forceful to me as if the director just shoehorned the scheme into the movie last minute. By then, I did not feel the urgency that the human race was facing any immediate danger. Furthermore, I felt like I watched this movie before like the first Iron Man and Ant-Man movie where the protagonist fights a stronger and much more evil version of himself. I also dislike the part where Venom suddenly changed his mind to help Eddie because Eddie somehow “changed” him. It felt weirdly disjointed because there was no buildup prior as Eddie did not spend much time with Venom and most of the time Eddie tried to get rid of Venom. I always see Venom as a villain who is strong and ruthless so it was a shock to me when he revealed himself to be a loser in his home planet. Overall, Venom is too “nice” and it kinda irks me. 

I however like the banter between Eddie and Venom. I think this is the highlight of the whole movie. The conversations were cheesy at times but it worked. I just hope Eddie could be a tad assertive instead of being the meatbag of Venom. Eddie appeared sweaty and pale during the entire movie like he gonna passed out any minute. The side characters though were bland and unlikeable. Even Annie was just there for the sake of being a love interest of Eddie. Compared to MJ in the previous movies, she just sort of exists. 

Overall, it is a decent and fun movie. It is not groundbreaking by any means but it is also not a dumpster fire like Catwoman/F4 I thought it would be. 

P.S. is it still gay if your bud borrows your girlfriend’s body to kiss you? I am 99% sure the lips Eddie kissed belonged to Venom. 
2018-10-07 03:43:24 my favorite part was when the two flubbers fought at the end
2018-10-14 08:44:27 I really didn't know what to think before going in, but I was pleasantly surprised by the end result! Yeah, the story kinda fell apart and felt clunky at times, I had no idea what was really happening during the Venom vs. Riot fight, and the CGI could've been better, but the upsides (to me) outweighed the negatives. Eddie and Venom's interactions were hilarious, a lot of the action scenes (swat battle and car chase) were badass, and I like that venom actually has a character to himself outside of "spooky alien only want survival".

Definitely not a top notch comic book movie, but one I would definitely watch again, and am looking forward to a potential sequel!
2018-10-15 07:36:38 This was a horrible movie. I loved it. It was fun, and I was entertained, what more do you want.
2018-10-06 10:06:14 It was cheesy, corny, cliche, and a pretty bad plot. And yet I loved it. Really entertaining movie that doesn't take itself seriously. It really reminded me of Deadpool in some of its humor and the personality of Eddie Brock. People want to hate on it for what it is not, but I feel you should enjoy it for what it is. Very fun movie and the 2 hours just flew by it felt. I will say that this movie definitely ruined the Venom character I grew up with.
2018-10-21 13:10:33 Went to see the movie because my friend absolutely wanted to see it and honestly it was a nice experience. Few things :

- the movie feels VERY short, probably because of its structure and transitions. It isn't necessarily a bad point, as I was entertained the whole time, but I will say the moment venom explains he's now Team Earth should have been longer (more explanations maybe)

- Can't Eddie talk to Venom inside his head ? Or is he choosing deliberately to talk out loud ?

- So great seeing Jenny Slate on the big screen and out of Pawnee

- I was a bit surprised when Venom and Riot came out to talk to "their humans" face to face, I thought it kinda took away of the whole symbiosis thing (I liked to think Venom's face was a mix of the symbiote and Eddie's DNA, but turns out all the symbiotes have that face)

- Tom Hardy was hot as fuck, per usual

All in all, it wasn't the best movie ever but I don't regret paying to see it. 


2018-10-06 04:41:21 So does anyone know what got cut yet?
2018-10-07 00:07:29 Did they not have security cameras?
2018-10-07 15:35:21 I was almost disappointed in how okay this movie was. I thought I was signing up for a glorious trainwreck, but what I got was a pretty average movie with some actually great moments. I surprisingly laughed out lout a couple of times, and it was WITH the movie not at it. Definitely some cringe factor hot topic type scenes, but I actually found myself enjoying it. Though admittedly the best part of my experience was the extended Spidey Multiverse look.
2018-10-07 19:36:07 I was glad to see Mike Tyson got a job again as the 'Rigging Gaffer'. Just goes to show anyone can come back from no matter how far they fall.
2018-10-07 23:31:13 It's sad because I think there's a legitimately good movie hidden somewhere underneath all the editing, studio interference, and bad pacing. I enjoyed it but can't say it's anything better than average.

Also, what happened to the yellow symbiote? The blue one killed the doctor and then died, the yellow one possessed a rabbit and then nothing the rest of the movie.
2018-10-09 02:15:11 Tom Hardy said they cut 40 minutes from it. It sure felt like it. The jokes, relationships, pretty much any story beat felt strung together in editing. Some scenes came off as almost incoherent
2018-10-13 03:41:12 JFK "We choose to go see Venom this weekend and eat popcorn, not because it's good, but because it's bad"
2018-10-17 23:18:54 Someone please explain to me why that doctor lady, despite *knowing* that Brock has the symbiote in his body, makes absolutely no attempt to contact him or tell him what his going on for an entire day! Sure she gets found out and apprehended, but basically an entire day goes before that happens. She even texts him back and says nothing about it for some reason despite having ample opportunity to do so.
2018-10-05 08:02:27 This was ridiculous. Tom Hardy is giving 110% percent in every scene. The lobster scene is worth the price of admission alone. 

I don’t even care how crappy this movie was because it was so goofy with the Eddie/Venom banter! “Tater tots! Chocolate!”

There are elements in this movie that are so dated — musical choices, the score, the beginning montage with Brock’s reporting... but all of it just adds to the charm of the movie.

Lmao, I can’t believe I enjoyed it as much as I did. 😬


2018-10-05 13:24:00 So how venom still stick into Eddie after he did "we are Groot" in the final act? And what years is this movie take place?
2018-10-11 07:48:41 So, the critics hate this movie, the audiences love it. I...... am indifferent about this. Like with everyone, Brock/Venom had some great scenes together and the humour landed most of the time. Additionally, some of the action sequences were well done like the apartment scene and the scene at the news building however the final fight was not very good at all imo. The rest of the cast were very forgettable, Ahmed and Williams were wasted in their roles. Some of the dialogue was just awful. I did liked Gorranson's score. The post credit scene was something I didn't care for. Can you have some subtlety for crying out loud instead of literally having Woodly stare at a camera and say 'There's going to be Carnage'. 

5.5/10

Edit: Any veep fans find it distracting that Reid Scott's character was named Dan.
2018-10-15 03:07:09 Can we stop having Woody Harrelson in a wig in every fucking movie please.
2018-10-19 05:53:30 It was a pretty decent movie. I definitely feel the pace could've been sped up, but it seems like they were playing it safe. The movie was actually pretty tonally consistent and might have not been with a faster pace.

Venom's motives were pretty cringy though. The fact they didn't hover over that with extra comedy was a good choice. 
2018-10-05 10:50:29 Better than Justice League
2018-10-06 09:09:10 [I don't want to say I fucking called it but..](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/93e9m1/_/e3cs52k?context=1000)
2018-10-05 12:32:45 What a weird movie. It felt like the entire movie was trying to take itself serious, everything besides venom. It was like they turned him into a hammy deadpool. 
2018-10-05 14:08:08 So Venom’s the new Spawn huh? Nice 
2018-10-06 15:34:17 The buddy cop dynamics of Eddie and Venom carried the otherwise mediocre movie
2018-10-06 19:45:14 It was kinda like the World's biggest game of tag 

"You're Venom! ... "

"No- You're venom now!" 


2018-10-09 08:02:19 You know, a couple weeks ago I really wanted to shit on this film. And it's not "good" by any stretch of the imagination, but was I invested in the movie for the whole duration? I was. Did I have a chuckle and even a couple of eye rolls cause of the script/acting (aside from Hardy)? Yep.

It's a dumb, fun time. Hardy is pretty great as well and makes it totally watchable despite the rest of the garbage. They're lucky it's such an introspective film in that regard.

But what's sad is that there is a good Venom movie to be had and you saw glimpses of that here, it just fell into trite storytelling. I still want a pseudo horror film with Venom, Carnage, and Spidey, but that ship has probably sailed. So for what it was, it's acceptable.
2018-10-09 20:54:23 I wouldn't call Venom a good movie but I had a lot of fun watching it.  I liked it much better than Predator, which I also saw recently.  Predator was a movie with almost nothing memorable in it.  Venom had some memorable moments and I think they tried to do some things in giving venom a fairly unique motivation for staying on earth, and going funny instead of gritty with the voice in Brock's head.
2018-10-10 14:11:24 One of the things I loved about this movie is Venom's tone of voice. While it might sound like sloppy dialog, a closer examine sounds like an alien who doesn't quite get the culture. It kind of reminds me of the two German freinds on family guy. 
2018-10-11 07:38:57 The movie was cliche and mediocre but Tom and Venom were awesome.
2018-10-26 11:48:32 Finally got around to seeing it. It was alright, entertaining but a bit silly and sloppy, but not a complete disaster.

6/10
2018-11-01 20:11:32 PILE OF BODIES

PILE OF HEADS
2018-10-05 18:23:20 So the movie isn’t necessarily good obviously, but it’s not bad either. There’s nothing new here, nothing I haven’t seen in something from Black Panther to fucking Little Shop of Horrors, but there’s nothing so outstandingly bad about this movie that it works against it. It’s bland, its characters are sometimes inconsistent (Venom saying “ur a loser” and using natural slang felt out of place (although “PUSSY” was hilarious)), and editing is sometimes dumb (music/shots/CGI), but it’s not making me actively groan at its characters or message like something like The Lost World. It’s impressive that a movie can be this cliche and still work better than something like Catwoman or even Suicide Squad, so its inoffensiveness actually kind of works in its favor. Regardless, if you end up watching it, stay for the last post-credits scene. It’s circlejerky of me to point it out, but it was like watching a movie in 98 just to see them play the trailer for The Phantom Menace at the end.

5/10
2018-10-12 00:46:34 "I know everything about you."

2 minutes later 

"Who's Anne, bro?"
2018-10-07 02:28:11 Opposed to all the hate this was a fun good movie. Not every solo movie has to be iron man level quality. 
2018-10-06 06:38:02 Glad to see the mode is 7

I’m frustrated that this was not a rated R antihero movie with more gore, violence, and profanity.  But it wasn’t as bad as the RT score suggest.  Hardy deserved better; he was the only entertaining part of this movie.
2018-10-06 09:22:59 I have to say, having gone in blind, I was not expecting [this.](https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/43103822_238829200117606_4611975722561437696_n-1.jpg)

Would have *much* preferred [this.](https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2016/02/LJZGNiYb.jpg)

I suppose time will tell if it actually works or not.  Assuming, that is, they even get a sequel.
2018-10-07 22:44:10 I liked the movie. I only found 1 thing off putting.
That was the sudden change of heart.  I wish they would have spent a scene or two showing Eddie influencing him with moral superiority. I guess it's hard to pull that off without being cheesy or copying the Terminator. 
But maybe one time Eddie can save someone without Venom's help.
2018-10-08 03:44:21 The first act was rather slow and choppy.  However I did enjoy the film once Eddie got the symbiote.  It wasn't amazing but I did like the entire thing.  My entire theater was cracking up when Venom would talk to Eddie.  I talked to several people while waiting through the credits and it seemed like most people enjoyed the film as well.

Edit: 7/10 is my overall score.

I also liked the Mac Gargan venom references
2018-10-08 23:39:31 Just got back from seeing it and I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Granted, it's not a perfect movie, nowhere near. But it was so much fun and had a lot of heart put into it and it doesn't deserve the critical lambasting on the level that it's getting. I had a great time with this movie. Tom Hardy totally crushed it in this movie, as did all the other actors, and I loved seeing Eddie and Venom interact with and play off of each other. It was goofy enough in the right places, but also knew when to play it serious, creating a dark comedy that is outlandish enough to work without feeling too contrived. There are some issues and flaws though, don't get me wrong, but it's not really trying to be groundbreaking cinema. I can't wait to see where they take this character. I'd give it a solid 7.5-8 out of 10 and can't wait to see it again.
2018-10-14 04:26:34 Yes the romance plot sucked, but it helped with the interactions between Venom and Eddie.

Loved the "we're gonna steal them back scene".
2018-10-21 12:14:22 I feel like Upgrade was a far better Venom movie than Venom. I wonder if I would have enjoyed Venom more had I not watched Upgrade. 
2018-10-05 06:05:02 Okay I'm going to say it; I actually enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. By no means is it a good movie, a lot of it is poorly written, acted, and thought out, but honestly every scene where Eddy is full on Venom had me grinning from ear to ear. 

My favorite scene is probably when Venom fights the SWAT unit in the smoked out lobby of a building. I thought that was visually a much better fight than the final battle.

Anyone says it's Catwoman level of bad is probably exaggerating, I'd at least watch this a couple more times when it comes out. It's a as FX Chanel of a movie as you can expect. 

Michelle Williams was decent in her scenes, but also looked bored in her other scenes. Tom Hardy's humor was a miss for me, and his Eddy Brock felt too whiney in my opinion, but that could just be me. Riz Ahmed has too much of a nice guy face to come off as evil, but his acting was great.

Venom/Anne and Eddy making out wasn't as crazy as the internet is making it seem. Yeah it didn't make sense to me, but whatever. Wasn't anything crazy. 

Like I said, would I watch it again? Yes. Would I pay to watch it again? No. I did appreciate how quickly the movie moved once Eddy gets infected with Venom, but that also doesn't mean it was paced well either.  
2018-10-05 19:23:23 This movie is fine and it knows what it is. It definitely isn’t “Catwoman-level bad”. Venom was the best part about the film and wish he was in it more. That climax was terrible. If the entire thing had to be a CGI battle, why couldn’t they just keep the camera still instead of making it a motion blur mess.

Oh, hey! Woody Harrelson!

Into the Spiderverse looks AMAZING! 
2018-10-05 15:05:44 I imagine back in Venom's home planet he was the nerdy kid who always got picked last in PE.
2018-10-22 03:30:42 Reading the reviews, I feel like I’m the only one who actually enjoyed the movie. Tom Hardy was excellent. 
2018-10-05 10:10:29 Like other have mentioned go in with lowered expectations. Was pretty funny and interesting but the overall cohesiveness seemed lacking. Venom’s arc was non-existent yet played as though he’s matured or grown to like Eddie w/o showing us why or how. The fight was nonsense and the villains acting/purpose made little sense to the plot. It’s jumbled and I believe Tom Hardy when he says there’s like 40 hours of improv. Dumb plot points but I REALLY liked Eddie and Venom’s dynamic. Give the sequel to a better writer and a clearer vision for where the character is headed. This film seemed like a demo tape. Very good concepts just needs better production and an actual storyline that doesn’t seem like it was written by a 13 year old. Could have been MUCH better but it’s worth a watch if you’re a Venom fan.
2018-10-06 22:12:32 I enjoyed this movie. I'd go see it again if I wasnt a broke student. 
2018-10-07 03:30:42 The restaurant scene with the lobsters was amazing 
2018-10-08 05:09:59 6/10. Every scene without Venom is a complete slog. Tom Hardy’s performance is hilarious, but every other character is a cardboard cutout. The movie feels short considering how much more interesting the 2nd and 3rd acts are. standout moment is the entire tower sequence: good humor and action with the Eddie-venom dynamic popping on full display 
2018-10-08 21:21:38 The movie wasn't great, but better than I expected. The goofiness, Tom Hardy, and the Venom/Eddie buddy comedy was its saving grace. If the movie took itself very seriously, it would have been horrible.

Give it more "Deadpool/Thor:Ragnorak"-style antics, less of the confusing CGI set pieces. Make the next movie R-rated, add more humor and banter, and I'll be sold!
2018-10-09 08:29:17 Flaws: Story was REALLY rushed. The moment we got to know how close Eddie and Anne were, they immediately break it off. There's not a significant amount of down time between Venom and Eddie after it sticks to him. Just kept the story moving along to get closer to the end. 

Aside from that, movie was pretty enjoyable. Got a bit sad when Jenny Slate died and when Anne-Venom first showed up, a little part of me wanted it to be Skirth. 

PS. Venom's "death" scene reminded me of a certain death in Kill la Kill 
2018-10-09 16:19:08 What are the chances that they re edit the movie and release a “Director’s Cut” version (with the 40 or so minutes that Tom said were cut, put back in) for home release?



Edit: Changed “R rated” to “Director’s Cut”.
2018-10-11 23:20:48 Had zero expectations ans came out enjoying it. Shit lazy writing though. The scene where Drake just kept repeating the same dialogue to Woody to send more things after venom reminded me of the 2008 hulk movie where the general just sends more and more things at norton's hulk. [Scene here](https://youtu.be/dkmrz0jPTBI).

Also that poor girl never got to ask her question because Drake cut her off.
2018-10-15 19:04:07 Saw the movie on Saturday night. I tried to go in as clear headed as possible after seeing it get the reviews it did. I will say the first 30 or so minutes was pretty slow but the amount of action taking place afterwards really surprised me. I thought it was a super entertaining and a fun movie to watch. Really hoping we get Carnage!
2018-10-15 23:28:39 Man, performances aside, this movie just felt like things happening because the script called for it.

Why is Evil Scientist Dude so ready to be a murderer?

Why is he even evil at all?

Why do the symbiotes need someone compatible?

Why doesn't Riot seemingly need someone compatible?

Why does Venom change host whenever the script calls for it?

Why does Venom become good?

Why does Venom decide to save Earth?

Why does Venom need to eat living things but then asks for non-living things?

Why doesn't anyone care when Venom bites people's heads off?

I'm okay with suspending my disbelief and just accepting certain things just are in movies, but a lot of these just didn't make any sense.  Venom explicitly tells Eddie that he's the reason he's good now, but doesn't actually explain why.  What did Eddie do or say or think that changed Venom's entire motivation for being?  I mean, it sounds like he's essentially betraying his entire species, that needs some sort of explanation.

And what the hell were they thinking making the big last showdown between two similar amorphous aliens, that are nearly the same color, happen at night???  Those two fighting were nearly impossible to make out.

Aside from that, I was generally okay with Hardy's Eddie.  Still not a fan of the accent, or his demeanor, but I can live with that.  Michelle Williams was a travesty though.  Her dialogue was just garbage throughout the entire thing.  I don't blame Williams for the poor performance though, there's just no saving that.

And I like Woody Harrelson as much as the next guy, but that fucking wig.  Honestly, I just don't see him being a great Cletus Kasady, but seriously, get rid of the wig at least.  He looked like a clown.

The score to this film was also really bad.  The most confusing songs for the action scenes.  Seriously clashed with what was happening on screen.

Honestly, I really hope there's another cut to this film.  This film was extremely tight, that so clearly needed more time to let things develop.
2018-10-27 19:35:26 Went to see it on a whim. It's an objectively bad film, but I really enjoyed at least the first 2/3rds of it. When the movie is Tom Hardy doing Tom Hardy things at his most Tom Hardiest, it was great. I loved the absurdity of it all, even Michelle Williams' and Jenny Slate's performances. That third act was just a massive bummer, though, and brought me down a bit.
2018-10-05 08:04:31 Act 3 was a straight dumpster fire, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel sad that this Venom won't be fighting Spider-Man. The full on symbiote action scenes were great, especially where he's just bounding around the city. That honestly made me smile.
2018-10-05 06:04:09 This movie is not good. But honestly? It wasn't boring either. It was kind of fun to watch, even if that fun was sometimes derived more from laughing at the movie and some of its odd choices. 

Weirdly enough, Tom Hardy is both the best and worst thing about this film. I think what bothered me most is that I just don't buy him as a news reporter. His character isn't articulate or well presented. In the beginning montage he looked and sounded nothing like a reporter. When he was interviewing Elon Musk guy he could barely string together a complex sentence. This is probably half the writing and half Tom Hardy just not being the kind of person who would report the news. Even if they were going for that cool hard hitting Vice type, I still couldn't imagine his character being any kind of reporter.

That said, when his job gets sidelined early in the movie he becomes more fun to watch. They spent too much time getting to where him and Venom are talking to each other but once we're there, and initially in the lobster tank scene, he's actually kinda fun to watch. The back and forth between him and Venom is fun sometimes but it really is a shame we got Upgrade earlier this year. It outshines this movie at almost every turn although I know that's gonna be a pretty popular comparison and opinion.

Outside of Hardy everyone else is fine for the writing they got. I was sad they killed off Jenny Slate because I really like her and honestly she'd be an awesome sexy evil symbiote. Michelle Williams was... In this movie? I guess? She didn't really do much or have any standout moments. I winced really hard when she had her fight dirty line. I thought it was funny she was dating Dan from Veep and his name in this was still Dan. Riz Ahmed had flashes of good moments but overall his character was so monologuey and tropey as far as the I am God bringing evolution to humans kinda guy. Whoever wrote this thing must have a huge hate boner for Elon Musk was my main thought. The movie even takes place in San Fran where Tesla's home base is (I think.)

Another upsetting thing about the writing is that the whole plot of the movie is stated by Hardy doing the stupidest thing he could ever do and blaming the outcome on everyone else. His fiancee is a corporate lawyer for space rocket company run by evil Elon and Hardy has to interview him so he breaks into her laptop and reads her work emails to use as a source against him. It gets him nowhere because Riz shuts down the interview immediately and the footage is never used then his fiancee is fired because it's the easiest thing to trace back to her ever. Like oh wow this reporter just had classified information about a lawsuit we're going through how did he get it? It can't be because his fiancee is our main lawyer. It does nothing to hurt the CEO and he ends up losing his job and his fiancee. I was glad Williams has that moment where she's like this is your fault but I don't think his character ever actually believes that. It's so frustrating. Why would you ever steal confidential files from your lawyer gf when you're both professionals in classified information fields? Total breach of trust and she was completely in the right to leave him. I really had no sympathy for him after that.

Perhaps the biggest shame is that I can see a version of this movie that works. Hardy's life gets ruined because of something that's not totally his fault, he gets infected trying to break a big story to get back to his former glory, and him and Venom have to learn to live with each other and he teaches Venom how to only kill bad guys and in turn Venom learns about humans and decides not to take over our planet. Sprinkle some good dialogue and comedy in there and boom, watchable movie. That all happens but it's all out of order. The very last thing that happens in the movie is they discuss killing bad guys only. Venom does this total 180 on taking over the planet at the end and his excuse is he's a loser on his planet. Kind of a funny moment but it was such a flimsy plot held together by scotch tape dialogue. ~~Pretty sure the evil symbiote didn't even have a name?~~ Nevermind, it's Riot. I missed that line. I assumed it was Carnage but then Carnage was teased at the end? And it's Woody Harrelson so perhaps the real shame is we will never see that because this is not getting a sequel.

I feel like if you're willing to laugh both with and at this movie it's worth a watch. If you're looking for only one or the other there won't be enough for you. I'd give it a 5/10 if only because it wasn't boring. I actually had fun watching it but I would probably not choose to do it again. 
2018-10-05 17:51:19 I liked the movie, it's fun.

Story is generic and bland, but the scenes with Venom are great, he was vicious against human soldiers (I can only imagine what it would look like rated R...) and fun. For me, Tom Hardy as Eddie talking and bonding with the symbiote carry the movie, and for that alone I recommend it if you like Venom.
2018-10-07 23:13:55 Movie was fairly entertaining. Not going to go down as one of my favorites but nowhere near as bad as the RT score made me think. Best part by far was Venom and Eddie Brock. Never thought Venom would be such a funny character. He had number of amusing lines like "I'm not unreasonable" or "She has no idea we're going to get her back". Glad we got plenty of Venom in his suit too. 

I do wish they'd done a better job showing Venom's change of heart. Felt like he went from anti-hero to hero a little quickly. I guess he's still technically one because he'll kill bad guys but it didn't feel that way.

6/10.
2018-10-12 03:03:58 I will never get over the "I'll help you because I was a loser on my planet" part. My brother and I burst out laughing. What a lazy way to bring on the third act, I love it so much
2018-10-12 16:30:05 I went to see Sony's [Venom](http://manapop.com/film/venom-2018-review/) with fairly low expectations - their history with the character not being the best - and I found this attempt to be better than the last but still a pretty big mess.

* The film was way too front heavy, when we finally get some nice Venom action the movie practically rushes to the end.

* Mustache twirling villain was beyond cartoonish.

* The editing was a mess, how much the final decision to make it PG13 instead of "R" is responsible for this is still unknown.

*  The scene with Venom announcing to Eddie Brock and his girlfriend that sound and fire hurts it was beyond sloppy.

* Venom's motivation to change from *"We will devour this planet!"* to suddenly becoming *"Team Earth"* was so thin as to be almost nonexistent. 

* Once again we are treated to a couple of CGI characters slugging it out, and not only is terrible looking it's almost impossible to tell what's going on.

* Tom Hardy's performance was about the only saving grace in this film, his banter with Venom was genuinely fun.
2018-10-13 23:42:51 I really enjoyed this movie. Yeah it wasn't a masterpiece and the story was generic, but I still had a good time. My expectations were very low so that probably helped, but I definitely want a sequel with Woody Harrelson playing Carnage. 
2018-10-25 19:08:42 I wasn’t going to see this movie because of the reviews, but all my gay friends became super into it and encouraged me to see it. I found it funny that that particular friend group was who ended up being into it, but then I saw the movie.

And yeah. I get it.

I enjoyed this alien-dude romantic comedy. A+
2018-10-06 23:21:05 I was going in expecting this to suck, but damn, this was really good. I honestly loved it. Don't understand why the critics hated this.

Also please do NOT bring your 5 year old kids to this lol. I had a ton of little kids in the theater for this and the parents were so mad.
2018-10-06 03:24:31 HOSPITAL
2018-10-06 11:08:10 Loved the Eddie/Venom relationship.  The rest was meh.  Action was super shaky, the fight against the swat team was cool though.
2018-10-06 16:58:26 Tom Hardy is always awesome. I feel like with anyone else, this movie wouldn’t have had the charm. It was a fun time. Glad I saw it. 
2018-10-07 00:19:35 i'd say it was decent, bordering on good. The dialogue was cheesy as hell and filled with one-liners, but I think that was to keep the casuals interested who may have been dragged to see it(like my mother, and it worked), but I still found them enjoyable and funny. I laughed a lot more than I thought I would and enjoyed the movie a hell of a lot more than I thought I would.

I was pleasantly surprised.
2018-10-07 03:07:08 This needed to be R rated. So many things I just felt disappointed every time something gory happened but I got no gore 
2018-10-07 06:27:54 It’s the worst and the best movie at the same time lol. I dig it. 
2018-10-07 07:12:29 Did nobody notice that in the above summary they say that " Eddie turns into The Mask" ?  


Where the hell did early -hot Cameron Diaz go????
2018-10-07 23:09:52 Not good. But a lot of fun.
I can imagine watching it with your friends on a saturday night just to enjoy how campy and cool it is.
2018-10-08 03:30:06 Hardy carried this on his back so hard.  He makes the entire movie at the very least entertaining. Everyone else in the movie plays it so seriously, and the problem with that is the writing is so bad that all of the other actors works (Ahmed, Williams) look pretty not great. Whereas, Tom Hardy really went for it, and didn't play it so seriously. He had fun with it and I liked watching that stuff. I also thought Reid Scott was pretty good as Michelle Williams' doctor boyfriend. I thought he came to play and he was actually really likeable.
2018-10-08 11:27:39 It was fun but the last fight looked like a Rorshach test.
2018-10-08 13:44:52 I came in with low expectations and it came out better than that. It's a dumb, crappy, soulless action flick but if you take it in the same way you find The Room great, this film won't be as bad. It is a *studio film* without a doubt.

Honestly wouldn't mind seeing a sequel if it means Carnage will be in it. 
2018-10-09 08:13:42 Do we get any resolution regarding the fact that the symbiotes cause their hosts' hearts to rapidly atrophy? Shouldn't Eddie be dead?
2018-10-10 05:28:39 I honestly really liked it. It was funny to me, venom himself was entertaining as all hell to watch and Tom Hardy really sold it as Eddie Brock for me. 
2018-10-10 06:23:18 Just came out of the theater and I had very very low expectations for the movie. After watching it, it wasn’t bad at all. Venom (the character) was something I really enjoyed especially his fight scenes with humans. Now outside of that, the movie has a lot to improve on. Especially the pacing. 
2018-10-11 01:55:42 I went in for a Tom Hardy/Venom movie and I got more or less what I expected.  I think the sequel(s) will be better because the exposition is dealt with and that was definitely a bit laborious but I like the character and I like the actor so I’m game for more.
2018-10-12 22:16:56 I hated everything in the movie except for Venom and Tom Hardy. The story was weak, characters were cheesy, villian was forgetable, and I didn't care about anyone else. 

When Tom Hardy wasn't dealing with Venom, I wanted to fast forward the movie.
2018-10-14 07:02:26 The Brock/Venom dynamic was awesome, even if the CGI wasn't.
2018-11-06 04:29:40 Just watched it

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY GOD YES 

Hahahahahahahaha 

Me before Venom: I'm not a monster fucker 

Me after Venom: [so](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5883cb863c9b14a78eccc4181ec0d21c/tumblr_php0d0PROt1uysam6_400.jpg)
2018-10-05 17:50:32 You see,  on my planet,  I'm kinda a loser.... Like you. 

This alone made me watch it twice,  their interactions were great,  Venom is cute... Worth the extremely looooonnnggg origin kinda story in the beginning 
2018-10-07 02:40:36 It started off feeling like a boringly-bad movie, but as soon Venom got into Eddie it became a really stupidly fun bad movie. Very entertaining. It knows exactly what it is. I highly recommend it. My cinema was full of laughter for the majority of the runtime.
2018-10-06 09:25:11 The idea that Venom is just a common loser on his home planet just like Eddie was kind of hilarious and heart-warming in a weird way.

I guess that’s as good an explanation for any as to why they “bond” so well beyond the biological compatibility, given the lack of Spider-Man.
2018-10-07 22:49:59 Saw this last night with pretty low expectations based on reviews. I found it to be enjoyable and fairly entertaining, nowhere near other unwatchable superhero movies. I didn’t like how they spun Venom into basically a hero vigilante in the end, I always thought he was a bad dude but oh well. Also the theatre I was in clapped at the end of it lol. 6/10
2018-10-05 20:45:01 Funniest bit for me was when Riz stood up for the little girl for wanting to ask a question and told off the other kids for stopping her...and then didn't bother to answer her question. Maaaaybe it was intentional since he's a villain but I didn't think so. 
2018-10-06 05:48:03 I thought it was ok. The action scenes were pretty good. The dynamic between Eddy and Venom was fantastic! 

I feel like Michele Williams wasn’t great (that god awful wig certainly didn’t help). 

Riz Ahmed was fine as the villain, not great, but passable. 

I actually really wish they would have pushed for the R-rating. With all the talk of biting off heads and eating various body parts, it feels like a bit of a waste that all that stuff was simply implied, not seen.  If they get to make another one with Carnage, I really hope they get to go full bore with it. Anything less would be a disservice to the characters (IMHO).

Would definitely love to see more of Lady Venom, probably never going to happen though :P
2018-10-06 09:27:23 Just watched it. I definitely thought the story was weak but the movie was hilarious. Story could have definitely been better. 6.5/10
2018-10-07 08:50:10 It wasn't bad at all...nothing special but entertaining enough. I feel like with some adjustments the sequel can be great, Tom Hardy plays Venom very well. 
2018-10-07 10:41:43 I have to say I enjoyed the second half of the movie a lot more than the first half. The development of Brock and Drake's characters/struggles along with introduction of Riot shouldn't have taken a whole hour imo. The first half of the movie could've been edited better, it was almost choppy like BvS. But once the symbiote got into Brock I felt like the movie started taking off and the ending was great. I know Hardy probably won't do another one but if he does I hope he gets more creative control since we've seen what he can do with a show like Taboo.
2018-10-07 10:59:51 I'm glad I didn't write off the entire movie for the line "turd in the wind." The Eddie/Venom chemistry makes this movie, and it could have used a whole lot more of it.
2018-10-07 11:38:36 Venom was a lil squishy cute boi and I kind of cared about him by the end 

My opinions are not to be trusted
2018-10-09 17:02:36 better actors for Cletus Kasady:

**Ben Foster**

**Sam Claflin**

**Dan Stevens**



**Boyd Holbrook**

**Walton Goggins**

2018-10-15 20:36:36 It's very obvious that a lot was cut from the movie (Tom Hardy said 40 minutes, which would be a quarter of the whole film), but overall I really enjoyed it.

I liked the buddy cop feel of Venom/Brock's banter.
2018-11-08 09:29:49 Did anyone bother to proofread the script before they hit submit?

I am late to the train on this (too many other good movies out this month and laziness on my part)

But Jenny Slate went from Ashley Kafka to some random lady that was wasted in the most idiotic way. Hey we gotta stop this, to being sloppy as hell and letting a journalist do whatever.  Then the crazy mad man she claims says trust him, shes like sure it was eddie. 


I don’t remember Venom having a fetish for eating people and still not sure why he wanted to become a good guy.

And Riot wtf, just shows up and rushed motive plot blah. I wanted some chemistry and background between Riot & Venom.

Welp no Man Wolf by the looks of it and She Venom was a nice touch.  When they said bad like a 2000 superhero movie, I thought fun like Daredevil and Punisher. More like Fantastic Four 1
2018-10-05 10:26:40 What kinda smear campaign is this? It’s nowhere near Catwoman or fantastic 4. 


Why is it that every superhero movie that tries to do shit different gets shitted on? 

Honestly. I thought venom was dope and I enjoyed very much. I laughed and thought the duo was cool as shit. Venom went from para**** to friend. 


I’m honrstly more excited to see Tom Holland face off against venom than anything he’ll do in the mcu tbh 
2018-10-06 03:33:14 Coming from a very die hard venom fan, the movie wasnt bad but it wasnt that great. Much of venoms origin story is lost not having spiderman in the film and with that a lot of his emotional distress too. The film tried to establish eddie brocks misfortune by showing him lose his job, his girl and his place all in the span of a few mins and i dont think it framed eddies dispair well enough. One of the reasons venom makes a great character is his internal and physical struggles and how eddie and the symbiote work together to overcome them. I just dont think the film did a good job establishing that. Another gripe i had with the movie was the symbiote's reason for staying on earth, stating that he is " kinda a loser" on his home planet. That is so dumb wtf. Also how the different symbiotes named each other or how they needed a specific or suitable host. How was it possible that eddies symbiote could jump from the dogs body to the girls body and then back to eddie if symbiotes in the lab couldnt bond to the test subjects. Or even more so riots symbiote moving from person to person till it found the ceo of the Life Foundation. I also didnt appreciate the dumb oneliners the movie had which in my opinion isnt something venom wouldnt do. The movie portrayed venom differently than the comics which was disappointing.

However there were good parts too. The visual effects of the movie were everything Ive ever imagined from the comics. The way his slimy tongue and body and suit looked was great. One of my favorite parts of the movie was how they portrayed eddie's and the symbiote's inner monologue. That was 100% true to the comics. The action was also nice and fast paced and they showed how truly brutal venom can be. All in all it wasnt the best movie but it wasnt the worst. 
2018-10-06 21:35:07 Went in with very low expectations. Actually surprised I came out liking it. It was a bit generic and a little too much humor but it somehow worked out. 
2018-10-07 05:38:42 I went in with low expectations.. and I really enjoyed the movie. Tom Hardy stole the show, the dynamic between Eddie and Venom was great, and I enjoyed the action sequences and the third act even though it was a little dark. Wish Hardy and Venom were apart of the MCU but alas, I really enjoyed the movie. 
2018-10-07 12:42:39 People were saying Venom didn’t kill anyone, but quite frankly that’s horse shit. Like 50% of that swat team is dead, you can’t beat humans with humans the way Venom did and not have pretty much all of them die. That being said I do wish you got to see more people get eaten. That’d have been a great addition. Also fuck the whole “venoms dead” no he’s not, we know you like money Sony and we know you’re not gonna kill a potential franchise in the first flick on purpose. Like why even waste time having him say good bye, and not have a scene where we then see him slink back to Eddie. It makes it look like he never even left.
2018-10-07 18:29:42 It was a complete missed opportunity that the movie Life wasn’t a prequel to this. 
2018-10-08 07:56:17 I might get downvoted but I will just say it anyway. This reminds me A LOT of the initial reactions to Suicide Squad. Critics thought it was trash but everyone else was like "nah their crazy its not great but its tons of fun! Had a blast watching it!".

\*Cut to two years later\*

Everyone: Ya that movie was trash

Will be interesting to see what happens with this one. Still trying to decide if I want to go see it or not so I can judge for myself. 
2018-10-13 19:51:51 The film was so fun! I went in with zero expectations and I was amazed! I absolutely loved the interaction between Venom and Eddie!
The symbiote fight was weird, I had a hard time figuring out what was going on.
The highlight of the film was Venom, I want to see more of his adventures with Eddie. 
2018-10-06 22:50:17 Holy shit I hated this movie.

Holy shit I loved this movie.

That's pretty much my review thank you goodnight. 
2018-10-07 06:30:37 I was very satisfied with this movie. Much better than rotten tomatoes' critics.

&#x200B;

The first time we got to see venom's face, a dad and his \~6 and \~9 year old daughters walk out of the theater never to return. 
2018-10-07 20:15:09 I had a blast! Loved it. 8/10
2018-10-08 00:26:38 Why was there a Wilhelm scream, it took me out of the movie.
2018-10-18 01:41:33 I actually liked the movie and i don't quite understand why it has so many bad reviews. It's not the best and it's not groundbreaking, but i think it's worth the watch
2018-10-19 02:22:19 I'm going to be in the minority thinking that this movie was actually pretty good. It probably helped that the trailers set very low expectations. But despite some plot holes (such as they forgot that Brock was never supposed to be a good journalist) and Venom being sorta hero-like, I actually liked the movie for what it is: a fast-paced, non-sense, CGI ass-kicking Marvel-like movie. And Tom Hardy - how can you dislike that guy? I think the CGI was top notch. 


I really enjoyed it. 


edit: Might be just because I have a soft spot for Venom. Venom is truly a great concept and the epitome of badassery in comic books. I even liked the first Venom in the old Spiderman movie.

2018-10-19 07:36:29 I really don't understand all the shitty reviews, did people expect an Oscar worthy drama? I know a lot of the Marvel sequels have been progressively serious in tone, as they are far further in plot, but these new movies introducing new characters, like Deadpool, Spiderman, Antman, and Venom have fun and unique humor. I appreciated the humor in this movie, especially when Brock walked into that fancy schmancy restaurant. It was also far more violent than I expected, to my delight. Totally messy plot and as a non-comic book reader, I really know nothing about the aliens besides how to take them down (they totally should not have revealed this at the beginning too). But overall, Tom Hardy was great as always... And totally swoon-worthy. Mmm in those leather jackets or fitted thermals.
2018-10-05 12:46:56 It was.. alright. Definitely not as bad as Fantastic Four or Catwoman. There were parts I enjoyed, like the nod to She-Venom and Tom Hardy’s performance. CGI was rough in the final fight. This is one of those not very good but enjoyable movies, similar to Predator. Good way to pass the time I guess.

I know they teased Carnage but not sure a sequel will happen.
2018-10-06 04:52:47 I just got out. I liked it. I thought it was enjoyable. There are things that I would have done minority different script wise, and a little bit plot wise, but overall I liked it. I thought it was fun and funny and it leaves me wanting more for another movie. 
2018-10-06 07:07:54 Wow, this is one of the dumbest movies I’ve seen and I loved every second of it. Tom Hardy gives such a crazy Jim Carrey-esque performance. The restaurant scene is the hardest I’ve laughed at a movie all year. I honestly hope there’s a sequel so I can see Woody Harrelson’s carrot top Carnage.
2018-10-06 07:18:53 Lol at that summary
>Following a scandal, journalist Eddie Brock attempts to revive his career by investigating the Life Foundation, but bonds with an alien symbiote that gives superpowers to its host, turning him into The Mask.
2018-10-06 21:27:13 Scenes with Annie were really hard to watch. Horrible dialog all around. The best one is when Dan asks her what's going on after removing Venom from Eddie and she just starts talking about her relationship with Eddie...that black blob thrashing around the room that was just inside another human being is perfectly normal I guess.

Eddie should also be careful about his job, a 5th-grade kid can do better interviews.

Would also like it to be more dark and violent but I guess all they do now is super-hero movies with comedy.
2018-10-05 07:33:21 Let me preface this by saying I'm by no means a movie critic but I really feel like I saw a different movie than critics, and some of the backlash on this film feels manufactured.  My son and I both loved this movie.  Was it perfect?  No, but Eddie Brock/Venom were fucking amazing and hilarious.  One 'negative' thing that really stood out to me in one of the reviews was the fact that Eddie Brock kisses the symbiote... so I'm waiting for this to happen, and when it finally does, he's kissing [She-Venom](#spoiler). 

My two complaints about the film are:

* The beginning part of the movie felt like it dragged a tiny bit.  Once Eddie got the symbiote (about 35-45 minutes in), the movie really picked up.
* Whoever decided to have Riot and Venom, two black symbiotes, fight at night time should not be brought back to work on the sequel.

I absolutely loved the [Cletus Kasady](#spoiler) cameo during the mid-credits scene, and the [Into the Spider-verse](#spoiler) post-credits scene was fantastic as well.

Also, hearing Venom call Eddie a pussy for not jumping out of the window got a pretty huge laugh in my theater.
2018-10-05 16:03:52 How accurate are the catwoman comparisons I've been hearing? While I usually love a good dumpster fire of a film i don't think I can take another mediocre superhero movie in my life.
2018-10-05 18:45:48 Can we discuss how freaking weird the mid credits casting choice is?
2018-10-05 21:08:16 I just need to know if they ADR'd "sym-BYE-ote" back to "sym-BEE-ote" since they cut Jenny Slate from the second trailer entirely. 
2018-10-05 21:42:56 i enjoyed the pacing of the first two thirds of the film, then the last act seemed rushed and a mess.
2018-10-06 22:39:15 I can't believe they cut the "the guy you work for is an evil person" line.
2018-10-07 00:57:00 Way better than I expected, I thought one of my major gripes was gonna be dumb/pandering comedy but there were a decent amount of scenes that got audible laughter from me and others. Also the lack of Spidey was concerning but once Eddie/Venom were together the pacing picks up and you get engaged enough to accept the changes. Great cast also, dunno why Tom sounded like a mumbling clown in the trailers, but he does a great performance. Like others are saying be careful with little ones because even though it has a PG-13 rating, there are plenty of head ripping and disturbing scenes.
2018-10-07 02:23:22 Been a day since I watched it and i’m further warming up to it. Worth seeing

and honestly I would not be opposed to a sequel.
2018-10-07 03:31:06 His boss calls him the “Best investigative journalist”. Felt like he was an 40 year old youtuber.
2018-10-07 14:41:32 personally i really enjoyed the film, had a good amount of comedy to follow the darker stages 
2018-10-08 03:21:47 i didn't like it as much as i was hoping to but I do think it set some decent groundwork for the Venom character and potential sequels.
2018-10-09 01:33:32 Tom Hardy was way better than the trailers let off. Him and Venom made the movie somewhat ok when I went in thinking it was going to be completely terrible.

Who ever wrote the parts for the female lead and cleared her performance needs to be fired though.
2018-10-14 01:15:47 this movie once included almost 40 minutes worth of footage Tom Hardy [could endorse](https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a23560053/tom-hardy-says-his-favourite-40-minutes-of-venom-were-cut-film/) is suspicious.

It felt like this was all of the footage they shot just for the trailer. Was it really worth the time to formally introduce the audience to Hospital-Dog??

**Sony**: "*We need to figure out a believable way to get Venom into Anne...?"*

**Screenwriters**:  *We'll put a dog in a patient's room during Eddie's first MRI!*

**Sony**: *Why is there a dog in the hospital?*

**Screenwriters**: *And the dog becomes agitated whenever Venom is nearby; just like Terminator!*

**Sony**: *Terminator's a great movie! Good work!*

Considering the unnecessarily arduous path the symbiote took from East Malaysia, I guess the *dog-Venom-Anne* detour could have been a lot worse.

But these are film school screenplay assignments. What's the likelihood Sony went outside and actually hired additional writers for script revisions? ...cause *Venom* is plagued with a lot of the same problems & bad logic, over and over again.
2018-10-14 19:35:47 I actually enjoyed this movie. Rough editing and the first 20 minutes or so kind of sucked but once we got Venom + Brock it was a really good time. Venom vs SWAT team was also fantastic  
2018-10-15 04:23:33 Avoided the lethargic feel of most origin stories.

Script was basic but not egregiously so, Venom's quips landed about 50% for me. A few of the misses were a little cringy.

Jenny Slate doesn't do or say one genuinely funny thing, and it doesn't appear like the script even had her try.

Bizarre lack of follow-up on Genuinely Moral Doctor Boyfriend. Eddie owed him an "I owe ya one", at least.

Visuals not great. Venom's tendrils seem like a CGI no-brainer. Final fight was basically the ending of The Incredible Hulk. Gray CGI vs. Dark blue CGI; incoherent.

Fight scenes too close up, the escape through the forest strained my eyes in the theater.
2018-10-20 23:37:58 They cut out a lot of part tbh, and from time to time you'll wonder what happened here or where did that come from etc and the venom character itself was very off screen, not as much as I expected it to be and it was a disappointment. But all in all it was a pretty good film, would definitely recommend that people watch it. 
2018-10-24 02:18:15 Hmm. Interesting experience this movie. The first 2/3rds I really enjoyed, especially all interaction and build-up between Venom and Eddy. It border-lined on too goofy, but for the most part it was fun and had an element of uniqueness to it.

The last act though is where it fell apart. Bland, painfully predictable, and at the end it all felt entirely pointless. Not every Marvel movie needs an epic ending, but even the seeming character development regressed.

I think I can still give it a 5.5/10 or 6/10, but just about.
2018-10-28 05:34:33 I think it’s an acceptable afternoon movie for people to watch at home. But to say it’s any worse than that is just wrong. 
2018-10-07 02:26:20 Can't believe I'll say this after the turds in the wind given to us in the form of trailers, but I actually quite liked it.

Eddy and Venom were amazing, action was decent and jokes were really good.

It's not perfect, that's for sure. His girlfriend, Anne, was the worst part of a movie and the villain wasn't much of a threat either. CGI was horrible at times, seriously horrible.

Still, good, fun movie. Solid 7/10 in my opinion.
2018-10-06 10:41:34 I really enjoyed Venom, it's a fun movie and Tom Hardy is just as badass as he always is in most of his movies. I admit after I saw the trailer I had mediocre expectations going in but was pleasantly surprised and entertained. Comedy was spot on too, loved the inner battle between Brock and Venom. I was impressed with Riz's performance, I thought he did a good job of portraying a grounded diabolical CEO as a opposed to certain actors who tend to play the character over the top. I hope they don't take too long for the next chapter.

We are VENOM. 
2018-10-09 21:32:33 I was *very* skeptical going in and had very low expectations, but I loved it the whole way through honestly. It wasn't ever boring, nor did it feel stale- but the first half of the movie did kind of flash by everything as fast as it could. 

Eddie Brock was a weirdo and a *little* cringy, but not super unlikable. He was fun to follow as much as the movie seemingly wants you to sympathize with him for trying to go back to his ex with nothing to show for. 

Venom was the best part of the movie at least, as it should be. His action scenes brought me right back to my *Ultimate Spider-Man* days wrecking New York and he was just as fun as a character. He was a weirdo too! 

The movie had the perfect tone IMO. Everyone felt lively, the villain was hokey, the plot was small-scale and to the point, and it wasn't mean-spirited at all. It was violent with an attitude, but never really dark or with outright comedy elements like what the MCU has since inspired. It didn't need to be rated R at all and did plenty for being PG-13. The filmmakers just need to grow a spine though. They did a fine job; they don't need to kiss Sony's ass every interview they do. 

Also, Woody Harrelson was the worst actor they could've gone with for that particular role and I have no idea what they were thinking. Here's hoping he can win us over next time :( 
2018-10-11 00:11:00 I liked it. It didn’t take itself seriously, which is a great thing. It’s flawed and nonsensical, but it was fun. It reminded me of the comic book movies before MCU. 
2018-10-12 22:32:57 I feel like if you take this movie as a standalone and aren't trying to apply your previous understanding of who Eddie Brock is with and without the Symbiote that it becomes far more enjoyable.
2018-10-05 10:25:36 So yesterday I went and watched Venom.  
I went in expecting a boring mess akin Fant4stic, but got out of the theater feeling it was okay.   
The movie does butcher the Venom character, if you're expecting to fear the symbiote you're in for a bad time.   
The most accurate review I found is this: https://www.vox.com/2018/…/4/17930900/venom-review-tom-hardy   
"Venom is a fun, twisted rom-com disguised as a bad superhero movie"   
The theater was full of laughs at all the sketches body humor that was present.   
Overall a 6 or 7/10, it was entertaining despite the usual CGI meh battles.  
2018-10-05 10:56:48 I saw this movie as Spider-Man 3 and Deadpool’s love child, but born with an extra chromosome.
2018-10-05 14:48:50 Anyonelse reminded of the game Prototype on the PS3? I feel like booting it up again after seeing Riot and his arsenal.
2018-10-06 02:46:01 One thing that for me definitely nailed was the inner dialog between Brock and Venom. Something that despite how much I liked Deadpool, was a big miss there.
2018-10-07 06:22:39 Much better than I expected it to be. A solid 7 / 10 for me. A few things were weird, but they were easily dismissed. Go in with low expectations and you'll probably enjoy yourself if you like dumb popcorn movies.
2018-10-11 12:50:58 Not gonna win any awards, not anything groundbreaking, plot was mediocre, and sadly no setup for a MCU crossover.

However; Tom Hardy’s performance and Venom’s portrayal were both amazing. The movie keeps you entertained the whole time, and is a very solid superhero movie, but it shouldnt be thought of as anything more than JUST a superhero (technically anti-hero) action movie. I enjoyed this movie more than I enjoyed a few MCU movies- notably I enjoyed it more than Age of Ultron- and I have no regret buying the ticket because it was an overall enjoyable experience. If youre interested in seeing it yourself, but on the fence because of critics, just go see it because youll probably enjoy it.

I do still hope that Sony does NOT continue the Venom films (or the whole concept of “extended cinematic universe for Spiderman characters that arent spiderman” films for that matter) and just sucks up their ignorance/stupidity and allows all their Spider Man/Marvel properties to be used in the MCU. They had the perfect chance to set up a much more successful MCU venom (that could have eventually had a better stand alone Venom film) with spider man being on planet Titan in Avengers 4. They could have just given SM the symbiote there and thats that.
2018-10-12 14:12:05 "Pussy".
2018-10-05 11:37:59 Serious question:  
how did Venom survive being doused in gasoline and set on fire..?  


My theories/assumptions are:  
\#1  That he landed in the water right after he separated from Eddie.  The water saved him & he reconnected with Eddie.  
\#2  He managed to divide himself (Voldemort horcrux style) and sacrifice one half of himself as a parachute, whilst the other half reconnected with Eddie.
2018-10-06 06:51:51 Wasn't amazing but wasn't anywhere near as bad as the critic reviews suggest. Decent, fun popcorn flick
 
2018-10-06 14:51:23 I thought the fundamentals were great. Will definitely queue for a venom 2. Venom and Blake were awesome. The importance of the bond between the two was underplayed. Enjoyable film that could have been amazing. 
2018-10-07 03:25:32 That was the funniest movie. I thoughts venoms sarcasm was great. 
2018-10-07 03:54:19 So did Venom actually eat the guy in the store at the end or what?  Or did the guy run away?  I thought he bit his head off but there was no body or blood anywhere so it was pretty confusing.
2018-10-07 09:35:14 I’m still kind of confused on what happened to the other two Symbiotes, did they die or escape?
2018-10-07 12:32:00 How exactly did Venom survive the fire at the end?

Kinda cheapens his line don't you think?

"Goodbye Eddie."

Lolnope I'm still here!
2018-10-08 02:46:25 I hope they make the sequel with Carnage R rated, other than that or was a fun movie.
2018-10-08 11:37:13 Surprisingly I liked it. Although some of the characters and dialog seemed realllyyyy dumbed down, it felt like I could write it.

Overall fun movie. I'd say 10 year old me would have loved it
2018-10-08 21:52:11 Whether or not you like Venom, if the concept interests you be sure and check out Upgrade with Logan Marshall-Green.

Venom was funnier, but Upgrade was unquestionable better overall.
2018-10-08 21:53:42 Storytelling wise, this movie falls short.  Bad pacing and bad scenes but the scenes with Venom were great, I thought.  Never really payed attention to the comics but venom is pretty silly and very comical.
2018-10-09 00:25:25 Michelle Williams' hair bothered me throughout the entire film.

I'm not familiar with the comic background, but Anne and Eddie just didn't work as a couple for me. She's way too put together and polished, and he's just greasy. 
2018-10-09 02:06:00 Anyone else think that when we saw the ship at the start of the film was called "Life" instantly think for a second it was linked with the Ryan Reynolds film "Life" that everyone was sure was the Venom prequel of sorts?
2018-10-09 02:50:13 Honestly it was like Tom Hardy was in a screwball buddy cop movie with himself and everything else about it was trying to be some kind of horror thriller.  It was just so.... weird.  Better than I was expecting though!
2018-10-09 04:49:24 The first 40 minutes are flat out boring.

The rest of it, if viewed as a mad-cap comedy, is pretty damn entertaining.
2018-10-09 06:47:20 It was better than it should've been. Sony is trying to stitch something together with whatever tattered remains of Marvel properties it has left, and I wasn't expecting much from that effort. So the bromance between Eddie and his slavering, man-eating symbiote came quite out of left field and left me delighted.
2018-10-09 23:07:20 It was alright, the action scenes were fun at least

I think this made it a lot harder to make a venom or Spider-Man movie with spidey/Tom Holland though, I can’t think of what venom/Hardy’s motive to fight him would be with them agreeing to only fight bad people
2018-10-10 06:05:00 So... 'Life' was a sequel after all?
2018-10-10 07:12:28 I thought it was cute. I loved Venoms personality. I was getting tired of prevenom movie. Not the movie of the year but I'd go see number two.
2018-10-10 10:22:16 I want more of this.  I know the setup was a lot of cliches, the bad guys get to blow up half of San Francisco with no interference from the cops, and the last fight was a CGI fest that you could barely make out....but that's 90% of these movies anyway.  Yes, even the MCU ones.  At least Eddie Brock deserved to get dumped and have life shit all over him for fucking over his fiance instead of just getting screwed over for always trying to do the right thing like every other hero.  It reminded me of the first Iron Man in that regard.

The liberating part of this movie was that Eddie Brock really wasn't the typical hero.  Watch The Avengers movies.  They're all Captain America at this point.  They only have any personality flaws when it needs to be a plot point.  Eddie has impulse control problems, isn't the smartest guy in the room, and has a moral compass that only vaguely points north.  He doesn't have fun with his powers.  They're a burden and only really serve to endanger the ones around him until he sees that they can stop an even bigger threat to other people.  It's not until the end of the movie that we see him really exploring the possibilities to benefit himself.  

At this point I don't need to see bigger battles and more team ups.  I just want to see three dimensional characters.
2018-10-10 10:31:30 It’reminds me of the movie I saw a few months ago call, “Upgrade”.  In fact,  that movie was vastly superior than Venom on every level.
2018-10-11 04:04:59 The people at the AMC asked for an ID despite Venom being PG-13. They said you had to be 18+ despite R-rating being 17+. Don't know what game they were trying to play there.

This movie got a lot of bad reviews it seems like, but I enjoyed it. It was strange how cooperative and humorous they made Venom, but those were the highlights! For the first half of the movie I thought Venom was the symbiote moving around human bodies. Kinda thought he would soon find Eddie and try to break the other symbiotes free. I couldn't tell if Riot's host was cooperating with him or what because it seemed like only Riot was benefiting.[ Still don't know how Venom survived despite saying "Goodbye" while being engulfed in flames.](#spoiler)
2018-10-15 09:02:01 I thoroughly enjoyed this when I didn’t expect to. Also carnage looked creepy at the end. I hope a sequel gets made. 
2018-10-27 16:55:56 As a movie, I found it actually really entertaining. Venom looked fantastic. However, specifically as a Venom movie, it falls somewhat short. 
2018-10-05 14:56:16 Gonna play the devils advocate and admit that I enjoyed it honestly. I’ll probably be downvoted but it’s the venom movie I’ve always wanted.

And the post credit scene, worth every penny to see Woody Harrelson as Carnage 😂😂😂
2018-10-05 06:15:52 Fuck the reviews. I watched it and I enjoyed the hell out of it.

Who else thought Woody Harrelson looked like Sideshow Bob instead of Cletus Kasady?
2018-10-05 20:15:59 Good lord, this isn't Fant4stic or Catwoman, or Suicide Squad level of terrible. It's actually okay. Just okay.
2018-10-05 09:14:01 Movie was really fucking stupid but I actually really enjoyed it. 

It’s much better than, say, Justice League. Which got similarly trashed, but was stupid and boring. 
2018-10-05 11:08:01 This Is the story of Tom Hardy living in an eternal hangover, he has abstinence symbiote and at the end he relapses.
2018-10-05 22:25:22 You're telling me this movie had a budget of $100M and they couldn't get a better wig for Woody ?


2018-10-06 03:14:42 I just saw this movie. It's not good but it's highly entertaining. Once Eddie and Venom merge it just becomes a fun ride with Hardy having a blast by not showering and going wild for a good chunk of time. If he keeps that energy up, I'd be down for a Venom 2. Especially if [Harrelson ups the ante by going buck-wild too](#spoiler)

There's also no second act either. Nothing makes Venom like Earth, so what the fuck? Must've been in those 40 minutes cut.
2018-10-06 04:07:26 I thought it was a pretty entertaining movie. The storyline was so off though and some special effects scenes didn't look right. The tone of the movie was also sorta weird and off. This could have been the next deadpool if it would have gone R and a much better script and Spiderman showing up unexpectedly.

She-venom was pretty dope, would have liked to seen more of that. It seems like the things I liked most, were cut short and where things could have been awesome and original, they went down the expected route.
2018-10-06 06:23:29 Tom Hardy and Venom dynamic was best part. Riz was good too. Don't know why he got so much shit. He's a caricature and he speaks with such vitriol. I liked it.
2018-10-06 08:30:36 The movie had its flaws. A lot to be honest. But Tom Hardy's charisma and his chemistry with Venom makes you forgive it all. I feel bad for the critics who cant enjoy this dumbness.
2018-10-06 12:58:22 I find myself agreeing more with the audience scores, perhaps my expectations were set low but I had a blast, absolutely worth the money for a friday night out.
2018-10-10 08:13:01 Good guilty pleasure movie for sure. Venom and Brock's relationship is the reason you want to go and see this film. Their scenes and dialogue together are absolutely hilarious in a weird way and the interactions they have always leave you wanting more. Tom Hardy, as always, does a fantastic job as both Brock and Venom. 

Plot is rather linear and boring, villain is super basic and forgettable. You could compare him to Steppenwolf in Justice league (remember him?). Just super generic and boring with his cliche motives and nonexistent character development. Dialogue between Brock and other characters (excluding venom) is also watered down and formulaic. Also, pacing is an issue in this movie. Super slow start, fast-paced middle (this is the best part of the movie), and hyper-speed ending. As soon as the things start to get interesting, it ends, and the boring parts (pre-venom) should be cut down in half at least and donated to the midsection or end.

Action scenes are rather fantastic, and once the movie picks up pace (after 30 mins or so), every scene is fun and entertaining either through the action or the interactions between our two (one?) protagonists. Score is awesome as well. CGI is... Unique. Not bad in any sense but you could tell they didn't have a large budget. Venom's animation IMO was pretty spot on, but aside from him and the villain, there's not much else they animate, not that they need to.

All in all, if you're gonna see this movie, expect fantastic acting from Hardy, hilarious and entertaining conversations between Venom and Brock, great action and satisfactory CGI. Everything else about the movie is disposable and forgettable. The core parts of what make a movie great are not there, but I'd be darned if you didn't at least rent the movie on a night in. It's great at what it does right, and I'm 100% gonna go see the sequel. 


2018-10-13 10:00:41 Saw it tonight.  Thought it was a fun and enjoyable movie with the bros. I love the venom voice scenes hilarious asf. Overall average fun movie.  Thought the plot and pace were mediocre. I didn't like the exgirlfriend/hospital storylines. 

Also how did that little blonde girl get into that maximum security prison? 

I'm excited for Carnage 
2018-10-05 07:12:08 The "Good-bye Eddie" at the end was overly emotional for Venom's character and unneeded, but I guess maybe Venom thought he was going to die. And they did try to make Venom act like a human using humor and expressing himself with words a lot. Venom would probably be a very good poet.

&#x200B;

The fight with Riot was too dark and I couldn't really see what was happening, and it felt a bit messy. Also it heavily falls into the MCU trope of fighting another version of yourself, except in here it's quite difficult to actually distinguish between Venom and Riot because they look the same.

I think a R-rating would have helped because this movie was like a zombie movie without any blood or seeing zombies eat people. Riot traveling the world to purposely merge into Carlton Drake was a bit plot forced.

&#x200B;

It was also never shown what happens to the hosts who were used by the Riot symbiote. Do they just fall to the ground and die once the symbiote leaves for a new host? Why don't they show it? Riot doesn't seem to stay in one body for a very long time in between hosts.

&#x200B;

The plot point as for why Venom stayed with Eddie was just lazy. "Oh, I was a loser too and I like this planet so let's stick together". It works way better if Venom wants revenge because Spider-Man rejected Venom, and if Peter Parker got Eddie fired. Double reason to hate Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Here, it's just weak resolve. I don't know why Riot wanted Venom so bad either if he was just going to call in more symbiotes to take over the planet.

&#x200B;

She-Venom was cool. Venom was cool too. Riot looked too much like Venom. Venom took over a dog but never became Venom-dog, missed opportunity. My biggest issue with the film is that they should have let MCU have all of its property back. That's where Venom belongs. Not in this world without Spider-Man. Venom could have been to Spider-Man what Loki was to Thor to a certain degree, and Venom could be more than a 1-time character.

&#x200B;

Despite that, the movie itself wasn't bad and I'd probably enjoy seeing more. It's an interesting concept since Venom isn't a superhero by any means, he just wants to.. well, he doesn't have a goal. Eat bad guys and just live life until the next movie, I guess. It's different and new.
2018-10-05 09:04:25 Honestly, this movie wasn't nearly as bad as the reviews made it out to be. It's not great but it's decent; the Eddie/Venom dynamic was pretty fun, the Venom action was cool and I really liked their relationship. I'd happily see another movie set in this universe, especially with Carnage being teased. Just make it R next time. 
2018-10-06 06:21:17 Just finished watching it and I gotta say, I loved every second of it. It was way funnier than I thought it would be and it was nice to see that it was a pretty dang hard PG-13. I wish it was R so Venom could get absolutely nasty with the baddies, but I don't feel as though the rating ruined it. Hearing "fuck" was awesome, not gonna lie.

The action was great. Venom is fucking hilarious. The "pussy" scene got me good.
2018-10-06 16:31:14 I went to this movie with low expectations and I have to say that this movie isnt bad at all. Its not a great movie but overall i had fun...It was enjoyable superhero movie... better than Ant man and the wasp in my opinion.

Major problem for me was the lack of villian character development.

P.S.- Black panther is 97 percent while this is 30 percent lol.
2018-10-07 06:18:37 This is nowhere near as bad as critics made it sound. dialogue, pacing and villain motives were what mad it weird , but  Spider-Man could definitely show up in this universe, same with venom in the mcu. The most unbelievable thing was woody Harreldon growing hair.
2018-10-07 18:29:59 Rotten tomatoes sitting at 32% from critics and 89% from audience. We reverse the last jedi now bois.
2018-10-11 08:40:25 Reading the reviews, I thought the movie was gonna absolutely suck and be boring however me and my mom were pleasantly surprised and we’re both very tough movie critics. The movie was maybe a little cliché and not amazingly written but it was far from boring. Venom’s voice throughout the movie was a great gag and I feel like Tom Hardy is obviously the perfect pick for the Venom role
2018-10-05 14:57:50 In all honesty, this movie was intensely enjoyable in some scenes, and borderline unbearable in others. It was a mess, but the most entertaining mess I've ever witness in a cinema. I liked it because of Tom Hardy's goofy performance; the only problem is that the irreverent dynamic between him and Venom (which was actually hilarious) could only bring so much to the generic, uninspired script. If this movie ran with the self-aware, carefree tone that it showed at times, bypassing the bland exposition and storyline, then it could have been something better than the final product. There's too many thematic elements conflicting that it feels like a bizarre hybrid of a buddy comedy, a superhero-horror film, and a send-up of the comic-book genre as a whole. However, the CGI looked like it was rendered back in the mid 2000s, the ending was horrifically anticlimactic, and Venom's relationship with Eddie was underdeveloped.

It's a bad movie, but a somewhat endearing awful one at that.
2018-10-06 08:25:33 Critics make you think this is the worst movie of the year. It’s a perfectly okay movie. Not a disaster at all.

How can movies like Rampage and Skyscraper get away with okay ratings and this gets stomped??
2018-10-07 13:18:48 Anyone else feel like a lot of the critics just saw the first 30 minutes of the movie and most of them walked out because of how terrible the pacing and editing was?

 That first act was brutal, but after Eddie got the symbiote the movie really picked up and became a funny buddy comedy. I can definitely see how people think the movie is crap if they only saw the opening act.
2018-10-05 07:32:27 Anyone notice they fixed the "Sym BI OAT" quote from the trailer and it was pronounced correctly in the movie lol. 
2018-10-05 09:11:33 A fun small movie.  Best part is the Venom and Eddie bromance!
2018-10-05 09:11:50 VENOM: best wingman ever 
2018-10-05 10:53:04 I thought it was alright. Went in without huge expectations and honestly, I came out relatively satisfied. Hardy and Venom's relationship was probably the best part about the film and carried it throughout, it had a lot of pretty funny moments and the fight at the end was pretty cool to watch. Having said that any character other than Hardy was underdeveloped and thrown to the side and the script wasn't the best. Otherwise I'd say I enjoyed it.
2018-10-05 11:15:03 A few things that bothered me: 

* Why would you call in a reporter and not discuss vital information before you sneak him into a super secret facility? 
* Life Foundation apparently had no security cameras
* Couldn't Eddie have e-mailed his editor the pictures? I don't see how leaving a phone with a note in a demolished office being a more reliable method 
* Also, he left his phone? Does he own multiple phones? Does he not need phones after he has Venom? 
* Venom could have easily killed Riot by letting him get into the rocket and pulling off the same move and avoided the whole fight
* Or Venom could have just brought along a flamethrower and killed him from a distance 
* Or just used the sound to hurt Riot from a distance 
2018-10-05 12:13:12 Not a bad movie overall, but I thought it felt a tad rushed. 

1) The interactions between Eddie Brock and the symbiotic were good, but could have been further expanded. Especially the last part after Eddie was stabbed by the riot symbiote and it crawls back to save his life. I felt it could have been an excellent opportunity to show them finally accepting one another. Instead, it’s just “I am back, bitch!!!”

2) Did venom really end up eating the crook at the end of the movie? I thought it was a rather shocking way of ending the show, and even the Store owner seemed quite chill about it happening. 

3) Would have liked more she-venom scenes. 😕 

4) The final fight was a CGI mess. 
2018-10-05 16:57:45 My wife pointed out Michelle Williams was wearing a wig, then every time she showed up I just kept thinking about the wig and hoping Venom would snatch it off. 
2018-10-06 06:06:09 I'm trying to figure out how I liked this so much, because so many things should've have been complete turn offs. Yet I was grinning and laughing quite a bit, more than I have at the theatre in a little while.

I totally get how critics and a lot of moviegoers hate it, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a good time. Saying it's stuck in the early 2000s is very accurate, and I also think it's a big reason I found it so charming.
2018-10-06 07:12:30 I think it was very different from what people thought it was going to be, mostly because of the dark and serious trailers. This movie was great in my eyes and was way more entertaining than the reviews suggested. 
 
This is why I think reviewers shouldn't see it before hand. It was not deserving of a 27% on rotten tomatoes.
2018-10-06 20:41:11 Good portrayal of Venom himself, couple of decent action sequences, but that's about all this movie had going for it. The writing and pacing were awful, the story itself was not good either and full of holes. If they can get some decent writers in there for the inevitable sequel, I think there's potential.
2018-10-06 21:12:50 That felt like a 45 minute episode on TNT stretched to 2 hours. everyone’s relationship to each other is so poorly written my lord. you never really feel threatened by Riz even though he had tons of screen time it just didn’t develop properly. Hardy and Williams are great actors no doubt just not much to work with on this one. the action sequences were solid definitely. And venom is still pretty cool. But yeah, I was worried about the hack director when it was announced and surely enough he’s cemented himself in that hack category 
2018-10-08 03:55:59 Saw it earlier today and these are my thoughts:

- Humour was a bit cringey at times
- The first action sequence was way too long
- They didn't spend enough time establishing the connection between Eddie and Venom, before Venom saying he wanted to stay on Earth because of Eddie. I feel like if they had spent a bit more time on Eddie and Venom instead of so much of the other things it would have been a better movie.

I wanted to like the movie and I did enjoy it to some extent, but it's really messy and all over the place with the pacing and the plot.

Cool CGI, though.

Edit: another thing I forgot to mention, so Venom says he is in Eddie's head so he knows all about him, but then he doesn't know about Annie??
2018-10-08 05:11:51 This is a worse version of Upgrade but with a better version of Tom Hardy. 
2018-10-13 04:31:11 One thing that I found very interesting is that you didn’t see anyone say “symbiote”

Everything was wide shots, VO, or the back of their head. No close ups.

Guess they really took it to heart when the internet got on Jenny Slate’s case for symBYEote and had everyone redub.
2018-10-05 09:34:52 When the little girl got in the lab late at night and transferred riot over to Carlton, I couldn’t help but laugh (not in a good way) over the fact that the first thing out of his mouth was “oh are you lost”.  
2018-10-05 12:55:43 Anyone remember how Drake's head of security guy, Roland Treece, died?
2018-10-05 22:17:46 I am more excited about Cletus Kasady than I was about Venom. I do feel the critics exaggerated a little bit, it wasn’t awful, but it could’ve been better. 
2018-10-06 05:36:56 Carlton Drake is the *WwwwoOooooooRrrsssssT*
2018-10-06 11:26:22 I'm a huge fan of venom comics and Tom hardy, so I'm a little biased but I really enjoyed it. There was some little things that took me out of it but the venom/brock relationship couldn't have been done better. It was enjoyable to listen to them banter. 
2018-10-06 13:42:48 I believe that if you go into this film not expecting much (which is what I did based on the Rotten Tomatoes percentage) you will be pleasantly surprised. I found the Venom-Eddie interactions to be very funny, however I do agree with some people that the main villain was a bit two dimensional. 

&#x200B;

Overall, it's not the a masterpiece by any means, but it was pretty funny and probably not meant to be taken too seriously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
2018-10-06 20:07:33 Venom talking about Riot: "He's got shit you've never seen!"

2018-10-07 01:26:31 It sounded like Tom Hardy was doing a Charlie Day impression for the first 40 minutes 
2018-10-07 03:43:15 I actually really liked the movie, most comicbook movies outside of Marvel haven't impressed me much but this one did
2018-10-07 04:36:53 Didn't expect anything much from this movie. The first 30 mins was pretty boring but when Eddie and Brock got  together, it got pretty funny. And the action scenes were pretty great. Definitely the highlight of the movie is Brock and Venom's buddy comedy.
2018-10-07 22:48:01 How about the throwback to the Emo Spiderman scene at the end?
Was it just me or was the tracking and walking very reminiscent of that Toby scene?
I thought so.
Also the Venom tongue kiss might also be a toss to the famous spiderman kiss scene.
It's like Venom was trying to 1-up Spiderman at every turn. No pun intended.
2018-10-08 10:51:36 It would be interesting to know what scenes, if any, were improved by Tom Hardy.
2018-10-08 11:55:09 I didn't scroll to far down this thread, but is it odd to mention Kryptonite in a Marvel movie? Shots fired?
2018-10-08 20:07:48 I think the main point this movie drives home (pun intended) is that there is no better location for a car chase than San Fransisco. The city's unique geography makes for some really interesting car chase action. 

the rest of the movie? it was alright. I was definitely entertained by it, but as I said elsewhere this movie would have benefited greatly by being rated R. 
2018-10-09 01:35:15 Just saw it yesterday and i enjoyed and would see it again... at home. 

Hardy does a good job but its not his best performance. "Hey theres a symbiote in my head, ok thats cool lets roll with it..."  
I would have liked there to be more fleshing out of the Eddie/Venom relationship. Also the antagonist, Carlton Drake is a very weak character. They try to make him out to bethis evil mastermind but the actor doesnt pull it off for me, and it translates to an otherwise underwhelming conflict between Brock/ Drake- Venom/Riot.

While the Anne/ Eddie relationship dynamic is overall pretty weak, its actually OK to me because it would resemble Deadpool too much. 

Lastly, as a side note, the Netflix Film Uprade essentially stole Venom's plot almost to a T, and even had the main actor be a poor mans Tom Hardy. 

Ill admit i am part of the low expectations crowd so maybe thats why i was pleasantly surprised that it didnt suck, but i truly dont think it was a bad movie. 
2018-10-09 07:48:48 I don't know if it was my low expectations or the delicious chicken dinner I had before going to see it, but I really enjoyed the movie.. found it surprisingly entertaining despite its unevenness and obviously bad casting choices. Movie was carried by its absurdity and randomly intentionally and unintentionally hilarious moments. Also, how did they go the entire movie filming her with that wig and not one person saying a thing about it? Oof.
2018-10-10 07:09:01 Good movie overall. Great action and good comedy where it needed to be.  [I like how Venom is more understanding in movie and sides with Eddie instead "grrrh I'm evil and screw you humans".](#spoiler) Solid action but hard to follow [I had no idea what was happening during most of the Venom v Riot fight](#spoiler).  
2018-10-10 07:42:40 I just have to say..

When they introduced Jenny Slates character, Dr. Skirth, I swear to god I heard Dr. Girth and almost exploded holding my laughter.
2018-10-10 14:45:01 I kind of confused why did Riot want the spaceship?
2018-10-12 23:34:52 Can anyone explain the post credit scenes? Isn't Carnage a symbiote? So does Woody Harrelson already have a symbiote or is his use of the word Carnage really convenient writing(because the symbiotes have their own names, so it's not like he can name it Carnage later on)? This guy is a serial killer right? So was that before having a symbiote or is it just a serial killer who now has super powers?

And as for the into the Spiderverse post credit scene, is that just a section of the movie they decided to give us a sneak peak of? Will I be seeing the exact same sequence in the first half hour of that movie? And if not, will someone else who hasn't seen Venom or didn't stay for this post credit scene be utterly lost and have no idea that Peter Parker died in this universe leaving Miles Morales as his heir? 
2018-10-14 08:38:26 I kinda liked it. Yes it has flaws but it was oretty enjoyable and the humor was good 
2018-10-14 18:22:17 So it's probably safe to assume that She-Venom is going to be a thing in the next movie, and they will tag-team to take down Carnage.
2018-10-14 23:27:45 Wife really wanted to see it so took her last night. Surprisingly the showtime we went to was a full theater. Overall it was entertaining and made me laugh. 7/10 for me. 
2018-10-19 02:03:20 My main problem was that it was made clear that the evil rich guy knew exactly what the symbiots weakness was and how to incapacitate it yet fails to utilize it even once then acts amazed and angry that his henchmens ambushes keep failing.

By comparison that boyfriend doctor who had never seen the symbiotic creature before finds out its weakness in about 3 minutes then immediately uses it to his advantage and removes it from Brock.
2018-10-05 08:21:39 This movie would have been amazing in 2008.





By today's standards, it was bad but fun 
2018-10-05 11:06:40 Venom said Eddie made him change. What? How? He was the most basic stupid superficial character I've seen. Nothing he did would've made a hungry parasite set on world domination change their mind. 
2018-10-06 09:34:21 This wasn’t even CLOSE to the level of bad the critics made it out to be. I actually thought it was good, and if it had a stronger villain/overall script, I’d argue it would’ve been *great*.

Like seriously, Thor The Dark World has a 66% but this has a 31%? Really?
2018-10-19 11:12:08 The plot was so fucking simple yet it made no sense at all.


2018-10-06 10:27:46 Will this movie win an oscar? Hell no. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes. 
2018-10-05 08:20:08 It's a bad, underdeveloped film, yes. But I really enjoyed it and had a lot of fun.  It started odd, and I'm sick to death of the big corp enemy trope, and yeah the dialogue was pretty shit but once Venom turned up, I had a time. I'm not familar with Tom Hardy or the Venom character, but I loved the dynamic between Eddie and Venom, the bants, and I just loved his character. I would be so down for more and more of him, so I hope this movie hasn't ruined his chances, because he's up there as one of my favourite characters. Sidenote - Riz Ahmed is the bomb, loved him in Rogue One and enjoyed seeing him here.  This movie is a time, and I'm totally down to see it again. 
2018-10-05 09:06:48 SO, is the movie LIFE a prequel?
2018-10-05 17:04:25 Man the humor and interactions between Eddie and Venom were great. It just nailed the dynamic between the two. The "legless, armless faceless thing" was great the way Venom's face animated in that scene.
Also the little spiderman type thwip he does on the walkway was super cool. Very entertaining movie.
2018-10-05 22:53:30 The first act is an awful slow burn, but once the symbiote binds with Eddie, and especially once he goes full Venom for the first time, the movie doesn’t ever relax. The Eddie/Venom dialogue and one-liners were the clear highlight of the movie, the action was decent (though the climax fight was poorly done, multiple factors resulted in the action being incredibly hard to follow), but it was entertaining enough I left satisfied. Hopefully, the sequel with you-know-who will be helmed by someone who genuinely knows what the audience wants from it and they don’t shy away from giving it the R-rating it deserves. 6/10
2018-10-06 01:49:28 Movie felt like it didn't get off the ground really. Like, I liked whenever Venom was onscreen and Hardy was alright, but it all felt so... rushed. Like someone just said "very by-the-book plot needs to get wrapped up now." It didn't feel finished, like there was gonna be more movie but they just didn't put it in.
2018-10-06 07:16:59 Do people not realize that's what Cletus Cassidy looks like?
2018-10-06 07:33:24 For context I went into this film ready to hate the shit out of it. The trailers looked dreadful, the lack of Spider-Man seemed like a stupid idea, and  the mere idea of a Sony cinematic universe pissed me off. I was seriously hoping the movie would bomb so they’d give the rights back.

However, I’m almost ashamed to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It wasn’t great or anything but I thought it was decent.If anything I thought it could have benefited from a longer run time to give more character development to Venom and make his change of heat at the end more fleshed out. I’m guessing this was in the 40 minutes cut out of the film Hardy talked about.

The other major problem I had with the movie was the scene with the exploding drones, that seemed a bit over the top considering that Drake would be committing basically terrorism.

Other than that, aside from a few bad lines here and there, I thought the movie worked pretty well. The actors were all good (which I was surprised by from the line delivery in the trailers), the action was intense, and the directing was pretty solid. People were saying the script was the problem and while it’s not Oscar worthy I think it was serviceable, I think the real problem is the editing and what they chose to leave out of the film. 

If I had to guess the Rotten Tomato score I’d have put it in the high 60s early 70s not the 30s it’s currently in. I feel like I didn’t see the same film the critics did. 

(Edited for clarity)
2018-10-06 23:20:31 I liked it a lot more then i expected. Glad i didn’t listen to the reviews
2018-10-07 06:01:21 Seeing Woody Harrelson as CARNAGE makes me think he’d make a fantastic JOKER.
2018-10-08 04:58:48 I thought it was going to be unwatchable from all the bad press I've seen. Definitely not a great movie, but it's not the worst thing ever.

It would be so much better if it was made for a mature audience though. 
2018-10-08 07:02:18 Im not gonna lie, i expected this to be an absolute mess. 

And it was, but my god did I have a blast. I would def see a second one if it gets made.

I would love to see this version of Eddie/Venom interact with MCU spidey just so Venom van try to imitate "saving" people [like this](https://i.imgur.com/Ij8CNvB.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/QyKYoDv.jpg)
2018-10-08 10:07:13 Multi-billion dollar facility... no security cameras.  Seems legit.
2018-10-10 11:54:22 Well it appears I am in the minority because I thought the movie was great!


Why? Well there's the origin story, keeping Spiderman out of it was a good call, he would have overshadowed Venom. ("OMG Spiderman #2!" and need I remind "Why is civil war a Cap'n movie and not an Avengers movie?") Anyway, they kept pretty true to the story, first a debacle in his reporting career costs him his job and marriage (going off script in interview vs. naming a habitual confessor as a real murderer) and in his following depressed state he seeks revenge on the one responsible (Mr.CEO who made his boss fire him vs. Spiderman who caught the real killer and embarrased him) he then encounters the symbiote and doubles down on the revenge whilst him and the symbiote are coming to terms with one another.

Now I also found it to be great precisely because it didn't take itself too seriously, it is very much similar to Iron Man 1 in that it is just a fun movie without having to worry about every character in the franchise like more recent MCU movies, and that is what a movie should be in my opinion, a comic book movie especially, also Venom may not be a fourth wall breaker like deadpool, but the comedic aspects of the character were great all the same.


As far as I am concerned this is more of an MCU movie than The Hulk was, i also include the Jane Thomas Punisher movie as well, it fits fine in the universe.
2018-10-06 04:36:14 Honestly I really liked it as it's own thing. Away from Spiderman, the MCU, and other stuff. It's a fun, slightly edgy movie. The chemistry between Eddy and Venom was really good too. Without Spiderman we don't need Venom using Eddy and his hate for Peter to get revenge.
2018-10-07 22:04:51 I thought it was good lol
2018-10-10 12:28:08 I don’t understand the critics hate. It’s a good and enjoyable movie. Still there are some unexplained parts and cheesy stupid screenwriting but still I had a good time. 
2018-10-13 23:46:05 Ok, but am I the only one who wants a venom for myself? Like, imagine all the possibilities:

\-during math test-

me: ok venom you're good at math whats 5x7

venom: you absolute idiot 35

me: thanks i'll let you eat a head if I get a c or more
2018-10-05 06:46:21 I went in with low expectations, but ended up having a pretty good time actually.

If you're looking for reasons to hate this movie, you'll find them. The plot is generic as fuck, the characters are bland at best, dumb at worst (Eddie Brock). There's no real body horror. The jokes are... weird? I'll get back to that.

On the other hand, if you're really looking for reasons to enjoy this movie you'll find them too. Some of the action is pretty cool, the plot may be bland but it's coherent and serviceable, and the humour *can* work. 

The good parts of this movie rely of whether or not you get the humour, and I could see that coming down to individual taste, or what crowd you happen to be in. It's unexpected and sort of pokes fun at the movie itself. If you're only interested in a self serious movie it won't work, and if you aren't interested in laughing half at half with the movie, it won't work. The audience in my theatre was into it, and their laughter was infectious.

I'm genuinely looking forward to the unrated blu-ray release, I'll pick it up, invite a fun loving group of friends over, down a six pack, and enjoy it in half laugh-at-it, half laugh-with-it kind of way.

Biggest thing I didn't like: Venom changing his mind without a plot related reason or demonstrated character moment. He just... changes his mind. It's deeply unsatisfying. The runner up bad thing is the lack of redeeming qualities in Brock. It's fine to be a scuzz bag, but you should at least show him being a great reporter but he's really not... And there's no way anyone would forgive him for what he did to his fiance
2018-10-06 03:46:14 I thought the directing was terrible. And the pacing all over the place. Did we need a shot of the LIFE headquarters from across the bridge every time someone there had a scene? Gave me that "and now back to the villian's lair.  
2018-10-05 06:51:44 I enjoyed it more then I thought I would.  The Venom voice sounded like Tony Todd to me but I read it was Tom Hardy.  
2018-10-05 07:53:24 Hmm... while its certainly not a perfect movie I actually enjoyed much more than I thought I would. Now there aren't a ton of surprises here. We knew Tom Hardy was the main draw, and of course he completely delivers. We knew a Venom origin story without Spider-Man would be clunky and uncomfortable (and the movie is certainly both of those things). What I didn't expect was how much personality the writes injected into the symbiote's characterization, he's almost at Spider-Man levels of chatty.  And when Venom takes over for the first time, he truly is an absolute badass. Even the sterilized PG13 rating couldn't make the first time Venom bit some dude in half not fucking awesome.

Now the things that weren't so great about the movie is a how shallow the story, villain, and supporting characters are. There's a lot of lazy writing and glossed over plot points that take you out of the experience (really too many to list). The director made a few questionable calls with Eddie's character, in this version he's an everyman good guy, just looking out for the people. Where as Eddie is usually a vindictive scumbag,  who grows into his Anti-Hero persona as he learns to control the rage of Venom- there is none of that here.

It's better than I expected, but not as good as such an iconic character like Venom deserved. On a scale of Suicide Squad-to-Dark Knight, I'd say this movie was somewhere around Blade 2.

Still I'd recommend it.
2018-10-05 10:14:17 On a scale of " **MANLY SCREECH** " to "I have parasite", I'd put this at a solid "I'm a bit of a loser on my world too"
2018-10-05 14:46:28 Saw the movie in IMAX last night after day one of New York Comic Con. The ovation for Stan’s cameo made my evening.
2018-10-05 19:36:38 One big issue is that Venom wasn’t really an anti-hero. He never harmed anyone who wasn’t a bad guy. 
2018-10-05 21:05:58 Anne: Is that like your kyptonite?

Me: *Visible confusion.*
2018-10-05 23:17:57 5/10.  CGI was bad during that terrible motorcycle chase scene.  Venom/Brock conversations were indeed the best part.  Question many people will ask is: "Can this Tom Hardy Venom appear in MCU?"  Although there were bad reviews, there would not have been a Venom movie in Disney's MCU anyways.  

This Venom movie was loyal enough to the comics where you could potentially see this version in the MCU.  That determination is definitely in Disney's hands...with my guess being no, and we'll know for sure by end credits of the next Spiderman movie because if you don't see Tom Hardy in the next few years, he'll likely be too old for the role, as Brock isn't THAT much older than Spiderman.  
2018-10-06 07:18:48 I thought the movie was very fun. First 30 min were boring but after he becomes Venom it’s awesome. Action scenes are cool too.
2018-10-06 09:36:38 I really, really loved it. Was happily surprised and can't wait to go again. 
2018-10-06 11:46:01 Mask... copy.
2018-10-06 22:49:08 I must say, the **horror aspect** of this movie was quite well done for a comic book movie. If they do make a sequel, it would be in their best interest to delve deeper into how terrifying the symbiote can be, especially with Carnage.
2018-10-07 00:56:20 I liked it. I want a sequel.
2018-10-07 01:54:59 Everyone seemed to like it in the theater when I saw it today , I liked it also
2018-10-07 09:06:35 Its established that symbiote has a very tough time finding a good match.
People are shown dying because the host rejects them.



Then how come it so easily fits into a dog and Eddie's girlfriend?
Shouldn't they have been dead too?
2018-10-07 12:32:07 I liked it.  Thanks to these comments I went in thinking it was going to be a moderately alright movie and walked away pretty pleased. 
2018-10-08 10:35:10 Honestly, it was a heck of a lot better then it had any right to be. I enjoyed the Brock and Venom batter (loved it actually), and appreciated it’s batshit insanity and humour, mostly Tom Hardy on that. It has some good action scenes, except the ending fight was pretty CGI overload and looked really messy and not good, but oh well. My biggest problems are the story beats that just simply don’t make sense, or don’t work (a symbiotie walked around for 6 months and nothing about that? , or the fact that Eddie was able to be in that room at Life with no cameras or anything?!), but oh well, I wasn’t expecting art. The writing is also atrocious sometimes, but like I said, I wasn’t expecting art. If you go in expecting the next ‘The Dark Knight’, then of course you’ll hate it. I had a lot of fun with this movie and am looking forward to what they do with the character. 

3/5
2018-10-10 00:39:46 The movie is stupid as hell but I really enjoyed it. I think it was marketed wrong, it's more like a Deadpool lite than the Iron Man sort of gritty origin story people were expecting. 
2018-10-12 09:09:45 Missed the first 10-15 minutes, but it was pretty easy to catch up.

It was entertaining.

The sound design of Venom’s voice was great.

Tom Hardy eating gross stuff was fun.

SWAT team scene was hilarious.

Im excited to see Woody Harrelson as CarrotTop.
2018-10-05 13:34:55 *”You’ve got a brain tumour, Eddie.”*
2018-10-05 18:07:23 Were the theaters full? Damn I really wanted to watch this movie but badly sick. 
2018-10-05 20:48:22 Saw this last night and I really enjoyed it. Went in with pretty much rock-bottom expectations, and while it wasn't a great movie by any means, it was certainly more enjoyable than something like The Predator that I saw last week.

I'm not a huge comic book superhero buff like some people so I don't know how true to the source material it really was, but I feel like the relationship/interaction between Eddie and Venom was done pretty well. To me, it passed the eye test of "Do I want to see this character again in another movie?" to which I answered heck yeah to myself.

A lot of the dialogue that looked super cringey in the trailer kind of "worked" in the movie, for me, after seeing how Eddie and Venom interacted. The "turd in the wind" line definitely felt way less awful than it sounded in the trailer, at least IMO.

I didn't like a lot of the Venom/Riot fight scenes. Looked too much like the jarbled mess that the Transformer movies end up being, where you can't really see a ton of what's going on. The Venom vs people fights were a lot more fun to watch.

Again, this movie isn't exactly a masterpiece but I'd say it's more 6/10 than 2/10
2018-10-05 20:58:50 Is there any scene that spidey showed up
2018-10-06 06:51:59 I went in with really low expectations and came out satisfied. I had no idea Venom was actually that funny in the comics. Now I see why Sony wanted to ride the Deadpool hypetrain with this one.
2018-10-06 11:29:04 Wish we got a full shot of She-Venom. She was dumb thicc
2018-10-06 17:08:04 I feel like the motivations for Venom were completely lacking other than the fact he was hungry. Otherwise, the movie was a lot of fun, and they managed to skirt the line between gore and violence to keep the PG-13. People do get eaten, heads get bitten off, and it gets talked about, but no arterial spray and hanging organs. 
2018-10-07 03:10:19 I really like the first half with the whole trying to reach symbiosis with the host and riot hopping person to person in order to reach drake and his rocket. Had some *The Thing* vibe.
2018-10-07 03:25:59 Just got out of the theater and I loved it! There were some rushed moments which affects the beginnings pace but once Venom and Eddie are together it was fun and the story was awesome! Definitely recommend seeing it for yourself.
2018-10-07 03:31:41 Thought I’d hate it, wasn’t at all interested in Trailers and Concept but genuinely enjoyed and loved it. 

Screens have been absolutely jam packed at my cinema as well - so I’m expecting it to do very well. 
2018-10-07 05:14:11 It was a solid flim. The dynamic between Eddie and Venom made the flim. There were some massive plot holes (How is venom
Able to bond with Eddie without killing him? Same for Riot)and it did feel rushed but I was entertained

I give it a B- 
2018-10-07 11:41:39 The second movie aka the three scenes we get from Into The Spider-verse were incredible!!
2018-10-07 20:17:40 Can somebody spoil me and tell me if it features Spider-Man or mentions any MCU stuff at all ? Thanks !
2018-10-07 22:44:26 I didn't have high hopes based off the trailer but I really enjoyed it, it was a lot more fun and funnier than I thought it was going to be.  A really nice surprise!
2018-10-08 03:59:17 When [the second post credits scene came up with the Into the Spiderverse sneak peek, I honestly thought it was announcing Venom to appear in the movie. The fact that it was only a sneak peek disappointed me.](#spoiler)
2018-10-08 10:06:37 I wonder how much they spent on CGI to make the little blonde girl's eyes shimmer to let you know she carried the symbiote you already knew she was carrying?
2018-10-08 20:46:46 So at the begining, yeah it's Eddie Brock's fault that he got fired and he lost his relationship but...

Surely the news... company he worked for had other people they could have sent to interview Riz Ahmed? I mean they establish it at the begining of the film that he's a bit of a loose cannon reporter who tells it as it is.


They wanted a puff piece to inflate the guy's ego so they could get by without incident. They could have sent anybody to do that.

EDIT: It would have made more sense to say... have him reject it first, then after rooting through his girlfriends computer to take up the piece so he could investigate.
2018-10-09 01:06:52 I really liked the movie much more than I thought I would after seeing rotten tomatoes score. But the only thing I might complain about is how fast the fight with Riot went. It just seemed like Riot was built up as this super powerful symbiote but then venom wins in few minutes of fighting 
2018-10-09 10:46:25 Honestly, I enjoyed it. It was like watching a super corny rom-com that just happened to have Venom as the male leads buddy.
2018-10-12 01:40:13 It was better than I was expecting, but it still had a ton of problems.

It was a "fun" movie but I wanted a whole lot more than that from this. Venom deserves more than that. Tom was great in the role and I loved seeing Venom as a character done quite well, but dammit, the rest of the movie was just bleh. The fight scenes pretty much sucked and the CGI was certainly not as good as it should have been. 

"Let's take a character that is literally pitch black and do most of his scenes at night." - Some dummy

I get that they probably did it to make it easier on the budget, but eh, it still hurt the movie.

Hopefully the movie's success will bring higher quality in all areas when the sequel comes around. 

It's flawed but I'm really glad it wasn't dead on arrival, because I REALLY want to see this character done well on the big screen. There's still hope for that to happen at this point.
2018-10-15 11:57:50 Some of the lines/clichés made me cringe. Venom was awesome and I loved his lines, but we should have seen him sooner. Action scenes were great, but it should have been rated R (he bites peoples head off for Christ's sake). Venom v Riot was really hard to follow so I hope they'll improve on that if Carnage vs Venom happens. I was not convinced by Harrelson, but we only saw him for about 10 seconds so can't really judge.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and it definitely shouldn't be 35/100 movie. 7/10 for me.
2018-10-28 19:18:30 >"Goodbye, Eddie."

Venom went full Senketsu
2018-10-05 07:09:43 I went in with very low expectations..from the reviews to the lack of spiderman...i didn't expect it to be amazing. That said, i wasn't bored, i actually enjoyed it. 

Movie starts off slow, and the writing is pretty bad. Some of the character dialogs are just really badly executed. Once the movie starts to go, it actually becomes pretty good and enjoyable. The action scenes are good, and the CGI while i thought were going to look terrible, kinda held up well. 

They did the venom character right in terms of design and i actually really liked the symbiot character and voice. 

it kinda sucks tom hardy was as eddie with this movie, it really would have been dope to have him with spiderman, but one thing i don't think would have mixed well was his personality in this movie. He seemed like a good guy in this movie which i don't think would mix well vs spiderman. 
2018-10-05 14:23:54 Wow I actually enjoyed it and found it hilarious.

I’m honestly what people would call a pretentious person when it comes to movies so I was expecting the worst from all the ratings. I was preparing to get a 3/10 movie.

The thing is I thought it was a great comedy. Venom’s character was hilarious and Eddie was pretty much how I’d expect a person to react if they were in the same situation, and Tom Hardy played the part well. I can’t really say much since I don’t know much about the source material but I assume everyone was expecting a more serious and violent toned movie which it isn’t and why it’s going to fail miserably which I think is a bit of a shame but inevitable.

In the beginning I was facepalming at the shitty villain, awful sets and cgi but around the middle I started to enjoy the jokes more. 

I think if you go in expecting a fun goofy movie you’d enjoy it a bit more.
2018-10-05 14:56:55 This is a definite 3/5 movie. Not a trainwreck by any means like Fan4stic but is a far cry from the films Marvel studios put out this year alone. 

The story feels like it hasn’t been touch since 2003 and was shot without making any updates. In 2018, the story feels incoherent, generic and characters motivations or change in motivations are barely explained. E.g. in the final act, Venom stated Eddie changed his mind. Ok, except their relationship had barely had time to mature by the time he said that. 

What saved this movie were the visuals as well as Venom himself. Tom Hardy does fine as Eddie Brock but is only half flushed out it feels. The love interest had piss poor writing and frankly was only there for plot enhancement. 

Woody looked awesome and definitely gave the serial killer vibe from him in the post Credit scene. 
2018-10-08 08:27:14 GLARING HIPAA violations in this movie. His doctor calls his ex girlfriend to give him his diagnosis? 2/10 overall.

Rest of the movie was fine.
2018-10-31 11:02:24 I went in with low expectations and I was very impressed with the movie, it was funny, the music and sound effects got the adrenaline pumping, it had amazing action and I grew to love venom. I don't know what people were expecting, in the trailers you can see that the movie isn't going to take itself seriously(the trailer where he talks about eating the guy in the corner store).
I look at it like this. The Dark Knight is the greatest superhero movie ever made, the bar that movie set will never be matched because no superhero movie takes itself seriously. 

2018-10-05 07:57:04 I had fun watching this movie. Although, I was confused about Venoms motivation for wanting to save Earth from that other Symbiote. 

Tom Hardy was fantastic and there was some serious charm with the whole Venom relationship. I just wish the film was committed to going all the way. Everything felt half baked. 
2018-10-05 08:50:52 I...didn't not like it.

I can see the problems, and how they could even segue him into MCU, but I still enjoyed watching it. Venom and Eddie were well done.
2018-10-05 08:54:53 I actually liked the movie. Shouldn't go in expecting a dark action thriller though. It's an action comedy. Venom looks comic book perfect. Except for the missing spidey sigil, for obvious reasons. 
2018-10-05 10:25:17 I enjoyed it. Venom was a fun and charming alien. Eddie was amusing. 

Loved the fight scene with the SWAT team..some other fights we're just hard to follow due to Shakey cam..
2018-10-05 11:27:35 I feel like this movie was decent. Good enough to possibly incorporate ONLY Eddie Brock/venom in a larger “universe” movie. For what the budget was, venom looked good. I could only imagine what he’d look like/be able to do with a big movie budget.
2018-10-05 16:40:23 I thought is was fun! Not amazing but not bad in any way.
2018-10-05 21:25:29 The film wasn't great but it wasn't terrible.  It was like a buddy cop movie which that aspect was great but that doesn't start till half way through the film.  It would be like if Lethal Weapon didn't have Rigs and Murtagh become partners until 1 hour into the film and you were just following Rigs around for an hour in his depressed state.  So for me it's 50% watchable and fun and then its 50% waiting for something to happen.  All in all disappointing, also the mid credits scene came off as super goofy, Woody looked weird in that wig man.
2018-10-06 00:28:43 the character work and character arcs were sloppy, you could see this was a few drafts away from being pretty solid. Venom and Eddie as well as full suit Venom were the best parts. 5 or 6/10
2018-10-06 05:40:06 Woody Harrelson as Carnage. Yikes.
2018-10-06 09:52:29 Dont understand the hatred for it, wasnt a cinematic masterpiece but anyone expecting such was set up for a let down from the start.
2018-10-06 10:01:40 Some thoughts:

- I actually enjoyed this more than I should have. I was hoping it would flop so they would hand the reins to MCU, but now I actually want to see more of this Venom/Eddie.
- Venom was by far the best part of this movie. I like how they incorporated his conversations with Eddie. I want to see more of their dynamic.
- "PUSSY"
- Lots of cliche elements and dialogue. Par for the course of a generic Sony movie.
- Tom Hardy's accent was noticeable but somehow acceptable? Mixed feelings about it. At least I could understand what he's mumbling.
- This would have been so much better with an R-rating. It doesn't even have to be obvious blood and gore, but dismemberment and body parts flying (especially during the lobby fight) would've been sick!
- Riz Ahmed really phoned it in. I didn't like his acting at all. His character wasn't trying at all to be likable or redeemable.
- The pacing was really fast in the beginning up until Venom merges with Eddie. It wasn't that bad, but it was jarring.
- I was hoping that the Doctor would successfully merge with the last symbiote and end up becoming Scorn! Too bad that didn't pave out.
- I reeeally want this Venom universe to merge with MCU so that they could explore the symbiotes' home planet more and eventually build up to the Necrosword and possibly make a Thor movie with Gorr.
- I thought the way they used Venom's abilities was really creative up until his battle with Riot.
- I also liked Riot and Venom's relationship. That Venom was actually a runt kind of ruined my childhood fascination of him being a BAMF though. He had the underdog story arc I guess.
- Pretty cool they incorporated Lady Venom. NGL I thought that shit was hot.
- I like how the new bf was actually a decent guy and trying to help. Glad they didn't give him the asshole treatment. 
- Hopefully Woody doesn't phone it in like Jared Leto. From the looks of it though I can tell the sequel will suck solely due to the fact it will be PG13. Carnage is as R-rated as a comicbook character can get, I just can't see it working any other way. Sony, plz take the R-rated gamble, I promise you people will bring their kids to see it anyway if Logan and Deadpool are any indication. 
- This is definitely one of the more mediocre superhero movies overall. Definitely not Catwoman or Fan4stic bad, I'd put it slightly above the Snyder DC films, mostly because they didn't butcher Venom's personality (still a bit odd that there is a Venom without a Spidey, but I'm willing to give them a chance).

EDIT: Thought I'd add a few more things

- fuck avi Arad anyway. There were some parts of the movie that were clearly trying too hard. 
- I realized one of the cool things about Venom was that his combat style was quick and direct in intense moments. He didn't savor the moment and take his sweet time. An example is how he escaped the cops by simply jumping and torpedoing in the water to safety.
- CGI was definitely rough. But the combat and movements at least had weight to them.
2018-10-06 17:14:05 Incredibly mediocre, plot was linear af, nothing unexpected happened, there was no real 'kick' to it.

&#x200B;

**PROS:**

\- Stan Lee Cameo

\- The car chase scene was cool

\-"PUSSY" along with most of Venom's interactions with Eddie

**CONS:**

\-I get that Eddie had motivation, but couldn't the doctor go to someone who would be a little more qualified to research and undermine the Venom project? Idk, this one's kind of nitpicking.

\-Everyone takes Eddie's transformation in stride way too easily.

\-The ex really served no purpose other than move the plot along. (Take Eddie in once he starts to lose it, delivers Venom back to him, somehow finds the right dial to generate that frequency in the final battle scene)

\-Wtf was Venom's motivation? He was supposedly tired of being a 'loser' on his planet, but didn't Eddie say he never wanted to see him again? The reconciliation, if you can call it that, was just put to the side, they were just like, "Hey, let's work together now" "K".

\-Why weren't the rest of the Venom creatures acting out and working to complete their objective of inhabiting Earth? Why was Eddie the "perfect host"? Just some stuff that never really gets acknowledged.

\-Extremely predictable, feels like they just followed a script template.

\-The de-horrification of Venom. I mean, I know it had to be PG-13, but it bugged me how they would cut away from all the gore. Also, the lack of blood, but that's more excusable. This is a  more minor flaw in my eyes though.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I think Sony just played it way too safe here, a shame because I thought the movie would have some potential despite my initial skepticism to the trailers. The opening scene was meant to reel you in I guess with all the horror, but it slowly just shifted into a more comedic movie where the jokes hit, sure, but it didn't offer much of substance. It was a good 2 hours of entertainment, but I really doubt many people will be discussing this movie a month from now until its DVD release. Just utterly forgettable with nothing you couldn't see coming.
2018-10-06 22:26:55 **Things that got laughs**
taking the elevator down instead of jumping pussy joke.
Symbiote saying it was a loser like eddie.
Did it feel good being inside of you annie joke.
Eddie calling it a parasite at the end.
Calling the mafia esque protection guy’s faceless armless and legless body rolling like a “turd in the wind”


**Visuals**
Looked cool when venom and riot were mixing together, 
Eddie talking to venom face coming out of his body will age poorly,
otherwise a good looking movie.


**Plot notes**
Pretty sure the wall of bullets that venom caught when eddie jumped into the room was a bunch of shell casings when they fell to the ground
Female venom looked cool, shouldn’t’ve been included for the only 30s she was.
Scene after credits going to high security prison.
Sets up Carnage!
Still said the cheesy “we are venom line”, but at the end of the movie.
The eminem venom credit song was good.

Overall I was entertained throughout most of the movie although some parts required some heavy suspension of disbelief / ignoring some things, and I hope carnage gets made.
2018-10-07 00:41:52 I liked the part where Venom said he knows everything in Eddie's head, but as soon as Anne calls he's like, "who dat bitch?"
2018-10-07 04:46:56 Honestly, I liked it a lot. It was a bit rushed and they didn't spent enough time on the relationship between Eddie and Venom but I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than I expected to. 
2018-10-07 05:01:33 Had a lotta fun. The dialogue between Brock and Venom was awesome and the action, although it would have greatly benefited from an R rating, was pretty great nonetheless. The scene with the smoke grenade and the swat team stood out to me. 
2018-10-07 08:51:16 I liked it honestly it was funny and entertaining 
2018-10-10 06:43:04 It was alright. Definitely as good as a Venom movie can be in a weird Spider-Man free universe, in my opinion. Tom Hardy was great. He really commits to the role and I think it might have been a very, very bad film without him. So, smart casting there! The action was good and all the symbiote effects were super weird and gross as they should be. More strong casting in the mid-credits stinger makes me kind of excited for this Spider-verse-without-a-Spider-Man.

One more thought, speaking as an old comic book nerd who often gets all huffy about comics-to-movie changes, I personally think "Venom, but there's no Spider-Man, I guess?" might work better and be a less annoying comics-to-movie change than "Instead of a talented, genius loner type, Spider-Man is basically Iron Man's sidekick, I guess?"
2018-10-12 13:14:26 Also the random Wilhelm scream and the Stan Lee cameo were pretty great lmao.

Also Eminem during the end credits was a nice surprise.
2018-10-05 10:37:15 I walked in expecting a hot mess... And, well, I liked it. I think it was a solid super hero movie. To be fair the movie benefited greatly from low expectations going in, but I don't understand the hate the film got.
2018-10-06 06:08:17 Wow, that was bad.

“On my planet, I’m a loser like you!”

Fucking Venom gets swirlies from the bullies on symbiote planet!
2018-10-06 08:30:44 I hate to pull the whole "the out of touch critics" thing, but I thought it was really enjoyable. Definitely not fine art, but thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.
2018-10-08 02:24:44 Venom would have to be my first childhood character that I liked that wasn't a hero. I'd been waiting YEARS to see a live action Venom and was pretty upset by Topher Grace's casting in SM3, but I think we all were.

I wasn't sure what Hardy would do with the role, but he's a good actor, so I was optimistic. Then came the problems, the trailers, and the trash talk and my optimism was fading. After reading the reviews my heart sank like a stone, but I was still going to see it, critics be damned.

I don't know what they want from a movie, but not every film has to be Oscar-bate, 5 minute long cuts of wistful staring in the snow.

Overall. I loved it. I'm grateful for the negative press for tempering my excitement and letting me enjoy it for what it was; - 2 hours of entertainment, and fun entertainment at that. There were plenty of laughs in my cinema and lots of enjoyment after a pretty slow start.

Hardy just nailed it as both Eddie and Venom, and I could have watched hours of banter between the two of them! The rest of the cast could have been absent and I would barely have noticed.

I'm glad it tracked well over the weekend because hopefully that means we'll get the teased sequel, although we could have done without that wig on Woody, holy crap, they've taken huge liberties with the story, we get it, you couldn't get Jackie Earle Haley, but just let Harrelson be bald. Don't throw a bright red curly wig on him and call it a day. I hope in the sequel the first thing he does is take off the hair piece and throw it at Eddy as a joke and say something like "he made it from his first victim" or some shit. 

Bring on the sequels.
2018-10-12 02:27:33 30% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes.

89% viewer score.

&#x200B;

What did the people in charge of this movie do to piss off the Hollywood inner circle?
2018-10-30 08:38:56 I really loved this movie overall. I like this take on Venom, he's not inherently a bad guy, just slightly amoral. Tom Hardy was a great choice. Main complaint was the pacing, they clearly cut too much footage out. Venom and Eddie barely get to know each other before the obligatory manufactured conflict between the two of them. Then all of a sudden Venom and Riot are duking it out and the movie is over. Hopefully we'll get an R-rated sequel to do the (apparent) next villain justice, and we won't have the pacing issue due to it being a sequel.
2018-10-05 16:59:39 Believe it or not, I had hopes that Venom might have been good. Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.

It wasn't all doom and gloom though. Once Venom finally shows up, it gets a bit better. For example, when Eddie and Venom are actually bantering and telling each other off, it can be entertaining in parts and showed some potential with Venom's character. Definitely the closest anyone got to laughing in my fully packed cinema. That's another problem with the movie, though. It's quite hard to tell what's supposed to be funny and what isn't sometimes. It really is all over the place. I don't know who thought toning it down to PG-13 violence was a great idea. It was disappointing they cut so much content out of the movie.

Most of the performances were average. The CGI was not that great. Felt a bit dated and Venom didn't look that convincing for the most part. The soundtrack was passable, I suppose. Nothing really memorable. Most of the movie was mediocre/passable. As I said before, the highlights are when both Eddie and Venom are the focus together, but when it turns to the other characters it becomes a bit dull again. The action sequences range from mediocre to passable, but nothing really stands out as memorable and stuff you haven't already seen loads of times before in superhero movies. You can predict most of the plot and the twist and turns from a mile away. The villain was generic and not all that exciting. I'd suggest sitting through the post-credits sequence though.

Overall I don't feel Venom was completely unwatchable, but could have been alot better. Adding Spider-Man to the mix would have probably elevated it quite a bit alone. Overall the negatives/blandness of Venom prevent it from being a good movie. I'm still unsure if I'd like to see a sequel to it in the near future. 5/10
2018-10-06 16:32:15 I literally don't understand how you can take a character like Vemon, who in the Marvel comics, would just bite peoples arms off for fun, and then make a PG-13 movie out it.  This is the Todd McFarlane Spawn film all over again.
2018-10-07 02:28:06 This movie is a mess and it's really rushed but I loved it anyway. Really fun, entertaining, Tom Hardy was amazing as Eddie!
2018-10-07 05:59:08 Saw a lot of bad reviews, so I went in not expecting much. I actually really enjoyed it though. I was seeing a lot of comparisons to the recent DC faceplants, but this was much better imo. Not on the level of the majority of Marvel’s slate, maybe, but certainly enjoyable. I’d love to see a sequel at some point. 


2018-10-08 00:09:03 My only gripe with the movie, and maybe it's me and I'm dumb, is that how much of a problem the bonding process between the host and the symbiote is shown to be -- until it just isn't. Venom just bonds with eddie. Riot just bonds with Drake. All the hyper metabolism and heart atrophy and all, it just ceases to be a problem. That's the laziest cop out I've seen in a long time.

Overall, a fairly entertaining movie. Tom Hardy single handedly propped up the movie.

6/10, would rent BluRay again.
2018-10-12 13:13:16 I personally loved the movie and I honestly don't think it deserves the harsh treatment it seems to be getting. Nothing 'amazing' but it was pretty solid in most respects.


2018-10-06 04:52:58 I enjoyed it. Don’t think the hate it’s getting is deserved.
2018-10-07 19:19:34 I don’t understand how this movie is hovering around 30% on rotten tomatoes while movies like ant man and the wasp are at an 88%. Venom was far from perfect but watching the relationship between venom and Brock made the movie so worth it. Drake as the villain was probably the worst part of the film but it doesn’t ruin it for me, he reminded me of cross from the first ant man. I guess any comic book movie that isn’t a part of the mcu is going to be graded on a much harder scale because venom was on par with some of those movies 


2018-10-08 02:51:39 I loved this movie. Critics and Redditors be damned
2018-10-05 13:43:44 A mediocre movie that leaves you feeling whelmed. It's not good but not that bad either. The pacing was off as the movie felt rushed in the last 20 or so minutes and I don't think anyone in their right mind would think they would actually  [kill off Eddie or venom in their supposedly first movie together](#spoiler). Also in classic Sony fashion, the trailer gave away a lot of the movie which meant there was little surprises. 5/10 
2018-10-06 01:26:34 So I enjoyed it overall honestly, having read some kinda bad reviews (poorly written with their opinion being the movie was as poor as their reviewing) I went in with low expectations. I had fun.

One thing to be said is that from the poster there are 4 "main characters". Brock, Ex gf, Elon Musk, Venom Symbiote. One of those has a character arc, the other 3 are the exact same through the whole movie and don't learn anything. It's venom. You may think that because Jeff Hardy gets all the screen time that he's the main character, nope. Matt Hardy is just a canvas on which our real protagonist is painted.
2018-10-05 06:35:18 Venom calling Eddie a pussy because he wouldn't jump out of the building was worth the price of admission. 
2018-10-06 02:55:07 Whilst it was a bit messy, I actually quite liked Venom

The first half was a little boring and slow but once Eddie bonded with the symbiote, things became much more entertaining.

Its a little loud and chaotic but its fun for the most part and the relationship between the 2 sides to Venom is great. Action scenes are a little hit and miss. Some are great but it was difficult to tell what was going on during the films climactic fight.

It might not be the quality of most MCU entries (I know this isnt MCU but thats the closest thing to compare it to), but I had fun with Venom and I'd watch a sequel
2018-10-05 06:21:46 This movie is so bad it’s good. Tom Hardy gives a coked-out comedic performance while everyone else is playing it straight and I love it lol
2018-10-05 09:11:02 I had a blast with this one, honestly. There were a few scenes that really felt like a horror movie, even if just for a few seconds, which I loved. The voice was incredible and his movement was mesmerising. I'll definitely catch it again in theaters.
2018-10-05 09:43:22 Why didn't the bad dude just check the security cameras lmao 
2018-10-05 16:28:01 If the audience scores are any indication, this isn't the last we've seen of Eddie Brock and his Sim by oats.
2018-10-05 20:14:13 Anyone else watch "Upgrade"? Similar premise and it stars budget Tom Hardy (Logan Marshall Green). 
2018-10-06 07:17:07 I loved the movie personally. I really feel bad for the people that can’t, at the very least, say it was a fun movie to see. I just hope the negative reviews and everyone refusing to see it don’t prevent us from getting more Venom and a chance to see Carnage on the big screen. 
2018-10-06 14:38:25 It was dumb fun honestly. It's a movie about a black snot monster living in a dude and them quipping back and forth. Critics are taking it too seriously, have a drink or two with a pal and go see it. Guaranteed good time.

2018-10-06 22:54:31 I saw the reviews and wanted to see how bad I could be but came out pleasantly surprised. I really liked the banter between Eddie and venom but it wasn't enough to sell me one venom wanting to stay on Earth. I would have preferred that instead of having riot roam around the globe for six months he should have "possessed" the bad guy at the crash site (and this would lead to riot killing the doctor which I believe would set up riot better). Final thoughts: it's an ok movie but I would love to see an r rated cut
2018-10-06 23:25:43 [Anne](/spoiler) as Venom was a baddie
2018-10-07 00:35:30 I really enjoyed it, I left the movie wanting more of Eddie and Venom and to be honest, I cant think of another movie where I felt disappointed that it was over. I think the bad reviews are because they expect the typical, bad circumstance causes super power, character learns to use power, all is lost moment, character learns to be hero and save the day. The problem is Venom is more of a buddy cop movie where two partners need to learn to trust each other with the catch being they share a body.
2018-10-07 01:25:09 Watched it last night, I will say I'm really easy to please for a movie but I did like it. I thought that it could have used a bit more meat with the whole venom liking Earth right away thing but I liked the chemistry with Eddie and Venom. "I like you Eddie. You're a loser, like me" 😉
2018-10-07 02:12:59 Looks like I might be in the minority here but I enjoyed the film. I hadn't seen the trailers and went in not knowing what to expect. I had an enjoyable time at the movies, was entertained for the whole run of it and really liked how they pulled off the Venom/Brock relationship.  

2018-10-07 03:02:50 Not as bad as I'd expected, given all the negative press I'd heard coming in. The script needed work, but the interplay between Eddie and Venom was fun, and the action scenes were decent enough.
2018-10-07 06:10:09 Fun movie. Enjoyed it a lot more than Ant-Man 2
2018-10-07 09:14:28 The credits are so fucking long. 
2018-10-07 09:55:14  I don't even know what I can say to convince people that this film deserves to be seen except that there is a scene where Venom gives Eddie Brock valuable relationship advice regarding his ex girlfriend. Like, that's a thing that happens, because this movie was written by someone who makes worse life decisions than you.
2018-10-08 06:56:02 I think the fundamental misunderstanding on the critical side is that this is very much a comedy and not a horror movie. There are a few vague allusions to possession horror as a genre, but it's definitely focused on the comedy. It's not perfect and the climactic fight was exactly as much of a goop mess as I expected, but seeing Sarah-Tai Black say she was "laughing at it so hard she started crying" then give it half a star is really frustrating.
2018-10-08 13:10:35 The movie is incredibly bland. It has no real theme. 

It could be a story about who really controls the body and the risks of relying on external help. You know, like Upgrade. But it isn't. Eddie and Venom just takes control whenever they want.

It could be a story about the unlikely friendship between Eddie and Venom. But they just become best buddies overnight. Then Venom was forced out of Eddie's body, Eddie didn't look back and believed Venom was killing him. And Venom never complained about it when he saved Eddie's ass later.

What about the conspiracy of the corporations and letting the public know the truth? Nope. We didn't even get a real closure on Life Foundation's case.

All it has are corny jokes, CGI actions and sloppy setup for the squeal. 
2018-10-09 20:45:39    I will say, after watching the film and laughing quite heartily at it, the best review I have seen is simply; The first 3rd is boring, the second 3rd is silly, and the last 3rd is fun.

   Do yourself a favor, grab some friends, and go enjoy unintentional comedy gold.
2018-10-11 11:21:21 It was cliche and mediocre but I still had fun watching it. The fight scene between Venom and Riot got too busy at times but I liked the interaction between Venom and Brock.
2018-10-12 19:05:11 I saw the movie last night and I enjoyed it.  I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  When {Venum called Tom Hardy a pussy after refusing to jump out of a 50 story building window I laughed pretty hard}(#spoiler)  I thought Tom Hardy did a good job and his back and forth with the venum was pretty great.  I was never into comics or any of that so my only knowledge of Venom came from the third Tobey McGuire spiderman movie, so I have no idea if they "STUCK TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL OMG RABBLE RABBLE" but to me this was a good movie about alien type life forms, basically a much better version of the Rampage movie and or part two of LIFE


2018-10-13 14:03:15 Not good but not bad. It's a mediocre film at best.

The pacing was a bit off in the beginning, actually the beginning was a mess. 

The fight scenes were okay, I especially liked it when Eddie and Venom were arguing while fighting enemies.

I don't really mind about the CGI though. It's passable. But it's confusing when the two were fighting as I couldn't see who was who.

The first post credit was a forced sequel grab, the second was a trailer for another movie.

Unpopular opinion, but I think that there should be more happening after Stan Lee's cameo; I really want to see the interactions between Venom and Eddie.

Also I wished this was a sequel to life.

2018-10-06 01:58:04 The most unexpected buddy comedy-action that I really enjoyed. Reminded me of the other guys. Also Woody Harrelson in that wig was priceless.
2018-10-06 04:27:30 That reveal with woody harrison as carnage was hilariously bad. Thought it was carrot top at first.
2018-10-05 06:48:40 Venom/Brock is the only entertaining thing and I'd watch him in another movie that isn't an all around garbage fire. 

So anyone else think that Bunny/Yellow symbiote was going to show up at some point? I didn't remember seeing it die and I  thought at some point there'd be a giant Bunnyvenom wrecking up the place. 
2018-10-05 08:25:11 I actually liked it 
Venom was hilarious
What were the names of the end credits songs? One before the credit scene and the one after. Thanks
2018-10-05 09:09:19 Tbh, Venom was a lackluster film. It had some decent action sequences and a couple humorous moments but the overall story was meh. The ending also left a lot to be desired. Overall, I was mostly entertained despite its shortcomings.
2018-10-05 10:12:09 I want a directors or extended cut as I beleive this movie had a lot of it removed as it feels like a whole plot point is missing. I also feel like if they re-edited this and reshot it, removed all references to venom and called it a parody of the superhero movie genre it would be acclaimed easily my favourite comedy of this year and it’s not supposed to be
2018-10-05 12:11:47 Can anyone confirm for me the names of the homeless woman played by Melora Waters and the asian EMT infected with Riot? The wiki says the latter is Donna Diego which would make her Scream, but that makes no sense as she gets infected with Riot.
2018-10-05 13:12:10 So how does this movie end
2018-10-05 23:15:40 Thanks to all the bad early reviews, I had super low expectations so at least it was more entertaining than I expected. But I definitely agree that it feels like something that was done pre-MCU where audiences didn't expect much from a "comic book" movie. The problem I had is the way this movie was written. Everything is spelled out like audiences are too dumb to figure things out and the villain was weak. Even with the blatant exposition of Riot being bigger, badder, better, it didn't feel like he was ever a threat to Venom. There really was nothing that made me want to care for Venom to succeed in whatever his goal was. All the entertainment came from Brock and Venom interacting with each other. I do think it should've been R-rated, but not for the violence. Venom has a very warped sense of humor and I'm guessing that's alot of the stuff Hardy said was cut out as other interviews the director talks about going too far sometimes. In my theater the biggest laughs came from the more absurd interactions, so if they went all out with his quirkiness, I don't think that would've hurt. I still feel like there should've been a Spiderman reference somewhere in there too. The stinger was interesting but I was hoping for Jackie Earle Haley instead.
2018-10-06 06:49:52 The random decision to just not bring back symbiotes to save earth felt a bit sudden and the explanation could have had more of an impact but other than that it was great
2018-10-06 07:02:29 I actually really enjoyed this movie. I had a lot of fun which is all I can really ask for with these types of movies
2018-10-06 12:11:24 This movie wasnt actually that bad sure its no Oscar winner but for one of those purely dumb entertainment movies it was great
2018-10-06 13:51:34 I find it a bit disturbing with the lacklustre reaction from the people who saw Venom in it full form in this movie. Like yeah if I saw a guy transform into this black liquidy monster with tongue like that and eyes that dont resemble human at all, I do find it sick, but I wont recommend him to go to the hospital. 

Edit : Was asking some questions and got the answer. 
2018-10-06 14:48:28 The scene with the SWAT team was pretty fun. Especially when the grenades were hitting Venom. I loved it.
2018-10-07 08:37:08 I know it's a comic book movie but you know something's up when you have a ton of questions after watching it like how did the symbiotes know english and gave themselves world accurate names like venom and riot. It definitely did not come to them on the fly because riot called venom by name before even meeting him on the movie so their names were already riot and venom back in comet symbiote
2018-10-07 08:59:28 So question, is J Jonah Jameson's son dead in this universe? He was the surviving astronaut that got bonded with the Riot symbiote in the beginning. They didn't show what happened to him after the ambulance accident and Riot bonded to that female paramedic.
2018-10-08 01:02:18 I felt like this could have been a great, cheesy B-movie, along the lines of Army of Darkness in terms of tone. It seems like Tom Hardy was the only one who had that in mind.
2018-10-08 02:22:32 I enjoyed the 2nd end credit showing somemore of Into the spider verse. 
2018-10-08 06:20:54 I liked it. It wasn't the most memorable move but I still had a good time. They made a lot of changes from the comics but they were good and didn't ruin the film ( cough cough gardens 2). 
2018-10-08 07:25:58 So I hate to be "that guy"...but did anyone remember the frequency range they said a few times in the film that are harmful to symbiotes?

My friend said he heard them say 4000-6000 Hz...which is kinda high pitched for normal human hearing (we can hear basically between 20-20,000 Hz).

However, I kinda call bullshit on that number...4-6 kHz are frequencies regularly used in the higher pitched human speech phonemes, so if it's frequency alone that disrupts the symbiote, it's a weird frequency to pick. Even going up to like 10 kHz is a sound that human beings can hear, but it's not in the broadband range of what we can produce when talking.

I know volume could be a part of it too...and being that specific isn't important in a comic book/action movie, but it'd be more accurate to say "4 to 6 kHz above 110 dB" or something like that.

Also, I looked at a study measuring sound qualities of MRI machines...they are loud in a way that could damage human hearing over an extended period, but the frequency range is like 50 Hz to 1 kHz with a sharp decline in the high frequencies...that's not nearly close enough to hurt Venom enough to detach him from Eddie (according to the movie's own rules).
2018-10-08 18:57:45 I've never read the (Eddie Brock)Venom comics but from what I do know of the character I believe they did a good job portraying him. A meathead loser reporter who makes mistakes and keeps blaming others. Spider-man 3 went wayyyy too far in the loser category(praying to god to kill someone because they caught you doing something illegal. Eddie Brock is a loser, not a pussy). I think this hit more of a believable spot. 
2018-10-09 04:00:05 Henchman #1 was lowkey Bill Burr lite...  His name was also Patrice right?
2018-10-09 05:56:38 I just saw it.  Wasn't too bad.  7/10. Needed to be rated R though not enough head/brain eating.  I hope they make a sequel 
2018-10-09 07:48:34 Although I didn't love it, I really really wanna see a sequel. 
2018-10-09 17:09:34 All of the Venom-less buildup was pretty much a slog.  I feel like that could have been cut in half.  Once Venom came into the picture the entire thing just burst to life, all of a sudden the humor clicked, the action was pretty well shot, the movie moved along at a clip, it was a lot of fun.  Venom's design was great and really looked great in motion.  I love that they almost went for an "Audrey II" vibe with Venom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
2018-10-10 07:43:05 I really liked the relationship between Eddie and Venom. I feel like the movie was a good popcorn flick and with some improvements in the writing/pacing could really be great. 
2018-10-10 09:57:15 At first when they mentioned the name Drake I was legitimately expecting the rapper to come out.
2018-10-11 07:02:54 So, did anybody else get one of [these](https://i.imgur.com/14fKGbF.jpg) when they went to go see it?
2018-10-12 01:39:56 I just got back from seeing Venom not too long ago and while it wasn't particularly great, it wasn't really all that bad either. You could definitely tell things were cut out tho, especially towards the end and was likely the reason why the movie had pacing issues.

On a side note, I went to see the movie in Real 3D at AMC since the showing started the earliest and I'm not sure if I was given the wrong ones or if it was a manufacture error, but I had some funky looking Real 3D glasses that had green/magenta lenses instead of the normal clear ones. It seemed to be a showing of the 2D version anyway and I was able to watch it normally, I also have A List so it was all the same to me either way.
2018-10-12 03:21:45 Tom Hardy was alright and I'm mostly fine with the characterization of Eddie Brock but that's really it. Was about as mediocre as I expected it to be. Probably not the movie you want to put 30 minutes of trailers in front of, either.

The fight with the SWAT team made me think Venom could succeed if it were like a monster movie. Wish they took it in that direction.
2018-10-12 10:27:46 When he kicks the door open after getting Venom while escaping did it not make any noise for anyone else? Like the score was playing but was there a sound effect missing?

2018-10-15 08:41:12 I really liked the movie. Seeing Venom in action was awesome.

What I didn't like was that it took an hour to actually GET to that part.

They could have shortened a LOT of that other stuff. Honestly, the way Brock was presented in the opening of the film made me really dislike him.
2018-11-04 04:41:51 This is the physical embodiment of a light to a decent 7 out of 10
2018-11-16 10:31:23 Actually surprised that the Golden Gate Bridge was unharmed this time. 
2018-10-05 06:33:09 [deleted]
2018-10-05 07:15:56 When you try to make a gritty Deadpool comedy action movie but accidentally land a Sharknado. I love this movie. 
2018-10-09 23:19:46 Saw it today and was quite surprised by it. Upon reading reviews and such my expectations were low but I had a good time. Tom Hardy's acting was great. The relationship between Venom and Eddie was entertaining and it just made me want to see more of that aspect of the movie. The villain was just okay. It was only a throwaway villain but did its job. Sure the movie has flaws but for a first feature length film about venom I think it did a great job. 7/10
2018-10-11 07:27:13 Okay. I just came back and WOW I have a lot of thoughts. Mostly about how I would COMPLETELY re do this movie with minimal reshoots. 

**First Scene**: Fuck the crash. Instead show them at Evil Bad Corp. Fake Elon Musk + Good Scientist talking about the experiments and then moving on to human trials already basically the same scene.

**Second Scene**: You see Eddie with a handi cam, sneaking into the Evil Bad Corp. talking about how evil they are how they exploit poor people etc. We walk through Evil Bad Corp. him taking video of everything and saying like "Eddie Brock here..", then the woman bangs on the door and is asking her to help him. Cue the same scene with the escape/chase. 

**Third Scene**: Back to Evil Bad Corp. Obviously they mad and Fake Elon Musk wants to capture Eddie. Good scientist is like how about we observe him for a bit, this is the first SUCCESSFUL bonding (Fake Elon looking shady here hinting at the obvious), blah blah. This will help establish time for Eddie+Venom to become butt buddies. 

**Fourth Scene**: Butt Buddies, friendship is magic scene. See them working together, end the scene with Eddie saving connivence lady. But obviously now he is seen as dangerous since footage is all over the news. BAD PRESS!! Back to Evil Bad Corp being like nah we gotta pick his ass up. Meanwhile Good scientist figures out weakness and starts getting hots for Eddie/venom since he being heroic + shit. Fake Elon low key realizes and is like "we can save him..." and she tells him. Bad move but she dumb so w/e.

**Fifth Scene**: Another good action scene and obviously gets captured by noisy drones. We now get confrontation between him and Fake Elon Musk, surprise! He has a evil alien in him too. Low key he's had one for a while because he was out on an expedition or some shit and discovered it. The alien was trying to get his kind also into others but can't seem to quite understand why some people work and others don't. Needed Fake Elon Musk to run the experiments etc etc. Evil Venom + Venom chat about their species and Evil Venom explains our world is dying we need these people, Venom is like nah people are good we must work together etc. Evil Venom is like do you not care about our people etc etc. BIG FIGHT.

**Sixth Scene**: Instead of them flying back into space maybe the rocket contains a beacon or something to contact their home planet to come here. Good Scientist is the one who does the sound thing instead since she you know loves Eddie or something. Evil Venom dies and the beacon doesn't get launched, as he's dying he says "Our people will not die, there are others who believe in my cause..." hinting at CARNAGE or w/e. 

**Seventh Scene**: Good Scientist meets up with them after the fight, she says she can help them for the time being and that she was the one who saved them earlier. Good Scientist+Eddie + Venom continue butt buddy adventures else where since they on the news/wanted. Venom being coy is like OH I FEEL THE HEAT FROM THIS WOMAN and Eddie like damn chill fam etc. They have new mission to find the others which leads us to ... our post credit scene and then it ends. 

OKAY THATS IT. Sorry that was insanely long and like 2 people are ever going to read it but I had to let this out. TOM HARDY I WANTED TO LOVE THIS MOVIE BUT IT WAS JUST SO BAD!! UGH!! YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT EVEN SLIGHTLY BETTER!! THERE WAS SO MUCH SOURCE MATERIAL, ALIENS TAKING OVER HUMAN BODIES?? THERES LITERALLY SO MUCH LITERATURE ON IT. EXPLORE THOSE CONCEPTS!!
2018-10-12 23:27:58 Wife and I just saw it. She is a big MCU fan and didn’t know a whole lot of Venom. She liked it except she felt Tom Hardy’s voice was a little whiney. 
  
Me being more of a Spider-Man fan I still enjoyed it. I thought “Venom” was portrayed very well even without the Spider-Man theme. Riot was a little bit of a let down. I felt there wasn’t a strong villain presence. But honestly they could have written it completely around Eddie and Venom’s origin and tackled how they come to grips with each other. The chase scene was phenomenal. The final fight not so much. Overall I would give it a 6/10. 
2018-10-18 00:20:34 Best Stan Lee cameo.

&#x200B;

Think the **fun** factor for Venom matches Deadpool, possibly will even pass DP, imho
2018-10-07 16:42:59 Was a fun movie to watch. I laughed a bunch. I mean it had issues, but I’m not going to go and judge a popcorn superhero flick like it’s a fucking Clint Eastwood joint near Oscar season. People treating every movie like they’re made to win gold trophies is unfair. Some movies are meant to be goofy. This movie does that pretty well. 

Btw Tom Hardy was really great in this movie. Without him, it is a turd. 
2018-10-05 07:43:45 That was pretty entertaining. I didn't expect much and well that was about it, but their execution with venom and the fights were pretty cool. I don't know if anything was announced, but hope to see some Carnage action in the future..
2018-10-05 09:09:57 It wasn’t nearly as bad as everyone made it seem like it would be. I thought it was fun. I’m also a big Tom Hardy and Jenny Slate fan so take this with a grain of salt I suppose. 
2018-10-05 09:31:49 I had fun with it, I went in with lowered expectations because I thought I was getting an R film instead of a PG 13. Really good job on the Venom character and Tom Hardy can do no wrong with his acting. Did feel like some plot point got cut out, but the story still held up. Really there was no need for the final fight if they had just waited for him to get in the rocket and then slice that rocket.
2018-10-05 09:46:57 It was kind of disappointing because there was so much wasted potential. The only reason I want this movie to make some money at the box office so we can have more Woody Harrelson in the sequel.
2018-10-05 16:15:20 It's alright, kinda what I expected. It's a PG13 Venom movie. 
2018-10-05 20:52:12 This carnage post credit scene, for me, did the exact opposite of what post credit scenes should do. When I left the movie, instead of getting excited for the next one and pushing away the the memory of watching a less than mediocre movie, I was annoyed to the point that I couldn’t even enjoy the tease for Into The Spiderverse. Already hearing about Woody Harrelson being casted as Kletus Kassidy was my primary issue, I had never been so sure what a post credit scene was going to be in my entire life. What didn’t help it either was the awful wig, and the less than entertaining (even cringy)dialogue. Maybe you were someone who had no idea that Kletus will be in this, fine. But I seriously question anyone’s opinion who didn’t think it was lame when he said “there will be carnage.” 
2018-10-05 20:53:01 The soundtrack was a little odd, Michelle Williams seemed to be just there for the she-venom bit, and the pacing was a bit off. Outside of that I liked this depiction of Eddy and the symbiote and look forward to the next film. I gave it a 7/10 in the poll and it looks like most people agreed with me. 

Good, not great. Not bad, but definitely could've had improvements.
2018-10-05 23:51:29 I really wasn't expecting Venom to be sexy at some point in this movie, but here we are.

&#x200B;

\*thoughitactuallywasprettysexydontjudge\*
2018-10-06 00:28:32 Movie had the right pieces in place to be amazing but they needed rearranging and we should have gotten that R rating

In other news Tom Hardy is the man and carried it enough that I was pretty much entertained the whole time (okay maybe not the first 20m)
2018-10-07 01:12:58 I wonder what 30-40 minutes were cut because there definitely seemed to be some pacing issues in the beginning. 

Overall I enjoyed it.
2018-10-07 07:54:02 Just saw it and reviews are too harsh on it. Second half felt a little too rushed and final boss fight was anticlimactic, otherwise loved Tom's acting.

I hope they make another.
2018-10-07 08:13:21 So if Michelle Williams makes out with Tom Hardy to give him Venom, does that mean she made out with that dog to get Venom?
2018-10-07 10:28:03 Expected nothing after seeing the reviews. I was entertained, not perfect by any means but the movie was good. Absolutely doesn't deserve such harsh reviews.
2018-10-07 10:54:26 I thought this movie was fine, I actually liked it very much. I wouldn't really rate it that much lower than all the other generic blockbuster movies. This actually is able to standout more because of Tom Hardy's fantastic physical performance. The second half is just hilarious. His back and forth with venom is really well done and something I would like to see more of in a sequel.

To some the absurdity might turn them off, but I love that sort of stuff. They went all in on the over the top nature of his body being taken over. 
2018-10-07 22:46:12 I’m confused by a lot of comments saying how eddy and Anne didn’t have chemistry. They got divorced. Divorced people don’t have chemistry
2018-10-08 08:29:40 200m opening. Nice.. 
2018-10-08 09:16:23 deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8901  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/16254)
2018-10-08 12:32:29 It was a pretty fun movie to watch. I never went to the cinema expecting an Oscar performance or anything, I went in expecting a movie full of action and some comedy and that's what I got. I'm happy the movie didn't take itself too seriously and it didn't focus too much on something dull like Brock's love life.

Loved Tom Hardy's performance, loved Venom's character and reason to stay on Earth being a small fish on his planet but he can be a shark on Earth.

Things I didn't like/get:

1. Damn it was loud at some points.
2. Idk why Riot needed to break out in the beginning only to walk back to the place he was going initially. I just felt the whole Riot breaking out in the beginning could have been scrapped for Riot gets to the lab like the other symbiotes, then breaks out there and infects Drake as he did.

All in all I liked it. It was worth the watch.
2018-10-09 09:48:21 That wilhelm scream at the news station fight ripped me right out of the movie.
2018-10-15 00:10:35 Decent, fun adventure at the start, then slowly devolves into a generic wannabe superhero movie with an evil entity who shoots back quips with a quippy character.

I think Venom talks too much and the pacing was very quick.

It's another fun movie that doesn't try too hard. A good flick to watch on a boring saturday.
2018-10-28 18:21:36 This movie was awesome. The action scenes were intense and interesting, the storyline was cool, the acting was great. It was a thoroughly enjoyable erotic exploration of the psychosexual relationship between a symbiote and his host and I loved every minute of it. 
2018-10-29 03:12:21 Almost missed out on watching this movie due to the review and holy crap I was blown away by it, definitely one of my favorite Superhero movies. I enjoyed the experience more than the average Marvel movie, probably because it had a very different structure to what I'm used to. It wasn't a movie of Eddie Brock on a journey of self-discover or learning heroism or anything of the sorts and it always had a crude vibe due to the violent nature of Venom. It's kinda like Logan. It didn't feel like a "hero movie", it was a normal movie with superpowers added to it. Except for the last bit with Venom vs Riot but whatever.

It might have objective flaws, but I guess I had superhero fatigue and I really enjoyed its uniqueness. I don't think the flaws matter at all if the final product was fun.
2018-10-05 06:50:04 It's awful. I love it.

Nobody should see this movie. But I'm glad I did.

It's the movie equivalent of that video your friend recorded when they were 10 and they are completely embarrased by every frame of it. Only with a budget.
2018-10-05 12:35:15 Like a turd..... in the wind
2018-10-06 06:35:42 I was expecting something absolutely abysmal, I'm talking suicide squad tier, but instead i actually loved this movie, the action scenes, the violence, the horror, the comedy, and the chemistry between Eddie and venom is perfect. I think it would of been a better film if the 40 minutes wasn't cut out, and the movie was rated R, but still this movie was hilarious and super entertaining, much more than ant man and the wasp. Sure the movie has its issues, such as bad pacing at times, characters could be fleshed out more, the villain was boring and horribly casted, but still i think the good outshines the bad, and i think the critics are absolutely wrong on this one, almost as wrong as when they gave black panther a 97% on rotten tomatoes. If i had to give this movie a rating i'd give it a light 8/10
2018-10-05 11:37:14 After the critics’ reviews, I was apprehensive about seeing this film on Wednesday night, but I’m glad I ignored all of those. 

Let’s get the negatives out of the way: the writing it fairly cheesy in places, and the budget is nowhere near the budget of MCU films, so overall the CGI and action sequences don’t look as polished.

But the film is really funny and the dynamic between Brock and Venom is well done. I’d be up for a sequel. Probably a 6/10 for me.
2018-10-05 11:44:48 I wonder what the rl Silicon Valley nerds are doing to the homeless 😕
2018-10-05 18:51:36 Okay, the movie had flaws, like it should of had a R rating, and the final battle was messy, but the ratings on RT and MC have it on par with Suicide Squad, which is one of the worst movies I saw in theaters in the past 10 years, which is ridiculous  
  
Venom in my book gets a 6/10 for me because of some aforementioned flaws, but it was still an enjoyable movie
2018-10-05 21:37:40 After seeing this movie, I’m convinced now more than ever that they should have just called “Upgrade” Venom and been done with it. Same premise, R rated, better execution 
2018-10-06 01:34:04 The movie was okay... BUT THE SECOND AFTER AFTER CREDITS SCENE HAS GOT ME HYPED.
2018-10-06 05:52:21 7/10 for me. First half was ok, gets way better after Venom's first full appearance. 

Action was good not great, but entertaining nonetheless.

I feel a sequel can even have the potential for a 9/10, for me, at least.
2018-10-07 01:53:29 I already am waiting for the sequel. Tom really sold his Eddie Brock persona and Venom as a character was awesome
2018-10-07 23:33:09 [deleted]
2018-10-08 05:18:53 You know it really wasn't that bad. My date enjoyed it which is all that really mattered. Overall a 6/10, funnier than expected really loved Tom Hardy hamming it up.
2018-10-10 02:03:50 Maybe my expectations were so low but I thought it was just okay not hot garbage or anything too drastic.

Writing was extremely poor and the direction seemed incredibly sloppy at many points.

&#x200B;

edit: The post-credits scene with >!Woody Harrelson...!<good lord that was awful. Might go down as one of the worst ones I've seen. The Into the Spiderverse clips were amazing though
2018-10-19 03:30:37 They make Eddie Brock a pushover. In a VENOM movie!

They have Venom say stuff he'd never really say (he was a loser on his planet? Come on!). 

Everyone says they like the banter between Eddie and Venom. There was no real bonding. No real turning Venom from ruthless parasite to understanding anti-hero. There's exactly one (out of place) scene where he looks at BUILDINGS and says how Earth is beautiful after all. He tells Eddie the reason he has changed his mind is "because of YOU, Eddie." But why? They didn't bond, Eddie didn't do anything to show him humanity is worth saving. They didn't have any meaningful dialog. Nothing.

I was surprised how bad the CGI was.

That Ronald McDonald wig at the end!!!
2018-10-05 09:16:02 Am I the only one who doesn’t get the hate for it? It wasn’t as bad as the reviews say
2018-10-05 07:04:52 Topher Grace killed it
2018-10-05 07:12:58 A huge disappointment. Somewhere near the beginning of act 2, the entire plot is removed from the movie. I say removed rather than lost because it is obvious that a decision was made to remove a huge story element. What remains is an act 2 and 3 that seem like they're from an entirely different movie than act 1. In one moment we learn that Venom is killing Brock, and then in the very next, Annie I guess decides to host Venom to save Brock and also we are all in love with Venom now and Brock has somehow made Venom realize the value of human life on earth. And also Riot is the most badass symbiote of all time and has "shit you've never seen" but we never see that shit. And somehow Annie, who was left in a forest, is suddenly inside the control room?

What a heap. 
2018-10-05 08:01:43 I'm just here to read about the shit show
2018-10-05 10:29:47 The hate is unwarranted. No it's not the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's no where near as bad as Catwoman or Fantastic4. I enjoyed it personally, and wouldn't mind a sequel.
2018-10-05 16:28:37 It was a *stupid* movie. Lines contradicted each other. 

"I know everything you know."
*RRRING*
"Who is Anne???"

...which would be cool if Venom was telling lies to Brock, but then why... and that other time... or when... argh.

Brock was a fist-fighty scrappy reporter pitted against a brilliant genius. So when the end battle came between Venom and Riot, I would've liked a brains vs brawn battle. It didn't happen that way.

There was one forgettable bike chase. Every other action scene was a blur.

Bad directing, fair acting, below average soundtrack, brutal script, and the best part being the final stinger.

4 out of 10 on that vote thingy for me. I'm glad Captain America: The First Avenger exists.
2018-10-06 20:10:25 I had a really good time with this film. Not sure why the reviews are so bad, its not fantastic, but its not 31% bad either.
2018-10-07 06:56:51 What a fuckin weird-ass, weirdly good movie. It honestly feels like a much lower budget production that's not afraid of doing whatever the fuck it wants.

The plot is as cookie-cutter "superhero movie plot" as they come, but Eddie having a hilariously bizarre rapport with the symbiote, and just the general weirdness give the movie an identity of its own, for better or worse. It also helps that it in no way feels like a launch of the Symbiote Universe^TM. It's a completely self-contained story with an ending, though one that obviously opens itself up to sequels.

Venom admitting that on his planet he's "a loser", and that being his reason to side with Eddie, was actually a fascinating angle on the character. I wish they'd done a little more with that aspect, rather than Venom being an edgelord made of pudding.

While admittedly a bit juvenile, I feel like a hard R would have made the film a lot more entertaining. Eddie being horrified by Venom eating a guy's head doesn't have the same weight when we don't even see any blood. As it stands, the film feels like it's going for a similar shade of the comedic violence of Deadpool, but the PG-13 rating makes a lot of it fall flat.

Final battle had some fun stuff, but the editing was so frenetic, shaky, and jump-cutty that it was genuinely hard to tell what the symbiotes were hitting each other with. If it's all cg, just make it a wide-shot, for fuck sake.

Far better than it's critical reception. I can't really put a number on it, because it's not even technically a good movie. But it's wildly stupid and fun and weird, and very aware of it.
2018-10-07 18:35:23 This was actually a pretty cool movie. Dont get the whole negative reviews
2018-10-05 09:07:19 Is this movie perfect? Far from it

Is this movie bad? Far from it

I think this movie was quite fun, funny, and gave good action sequences with an extremely memorable character. 

I hope to god that people ignore the critics and make an opinion themselves. Plus, I need to see Carnage, so I swear to christ that if y'all ruin that for me, imma be a lil pissed.
2018-10-06 04:21:34 So all of a sudden the symbiotes can bond to anyone? Weren’t they killing dozens of homeless people at the beginning? Midway through the movie they just stop being harmful to their hosts 
2018-10-07 18:38:56 Honestly not bad. Could have used more fleshing out which is what I imagine the 40 mins was. 6.5/10. 
2018-10-05 09:24:45 I think an R rating would have given this movie maybe 2% higher score on RT. This a 4/10 for me.

The movie was so slow in the first act... too slow and still skimpy on background info. These things can live on a comet with no air at all, but *need* a host on earth?? What about *their world?*

So sometimes they can exist for 15 seconds without a host before death, other times 20 minutes? And it all comes down to global warming.. again. Look I get that climate change is real and we should address it, but having it be a shitty sub motivator of the plot has felt cheap the last few movies (looking at The Predator) I saw with that element. The last film I thought that used it well as a theme and plot device - the first kingsman.

Also, there's several times where they call out something stupid (like anti hero deadpool would do), then proceed to do it or say it, in a more stupid way than expected! At least when DP does it there is still some charm and amusement in it.

Best scene was the fight in the lobby. Other than that, I found parts to be laughably bad. 

Why was Ronald McDonald in a jail cell???^^/s
2018-10-05 19:05:28 While it’s no Infinity War or Dark Knight it’s definitely not in the same league as Catwoman or other forgettable 90’s superhero flicks like some have claimed. 

Hardy deserves a decent amount of credit for giving Eddie much more character than what was on paper which also helps sell the relationship with Venom and in turn, the movie itself. 
2018-10-05 20:20:31 Double Toasted review: https://youtu.be/AiEbygBiyCc?t=44
2018-10-05 22:49:28 Just got back from it. Not as bad as the RT score but definitely not a good movie aswell. 

The positives first, first two action scenes were very entertaining, especially Venom vs the SWAT team. Tom Hardy was great. Especially loved his acting in the restaurant scene. The banter and interactions between Brock and Venom were...amusing and added depth to their relationship and I mostly bought their camaraderie. 

Now the negatives and there are a lot of them. The plot was very very weak. Filled with stupid logic and constantly breaking its own rules. They say that achieving Symbiosis is so difficult and how it’s like an organ transplant. We even see how a human horribly die when the body rejects the symbiote but Riot and Venom are just willy nilly switching between different hosts. From old ladies, to little girls to dogs. It’s just so jarring because you see these scientists struggling and failing to get perfect symbiosis but Riot is walking around the street just possessing a bunch of people. Also, they state how difficult it is for them to sustain the symbiote inside a host. Saying that they gave it enough liquid for “an elephant” but the host is still dying but Brock and Venom just eat a bag tator tots, an old chicken leg and drink a glass of water and he’s completely fine. Sure, the doctor states that venom has been feeding on Brock’s organs but there are physical ramifications on Eddie like there were on the other subjects. Also, why try to cram in marvel’s style of humor? Anne has just seen her ex fiancé, a man she cares about, turn into a monster and maim a SWAT team. He walks in on him about to EAT a human being and her reaction is to say “hospital”?! Is she not even horrified by the fact that she just saw an alien monster? The writing is comical at points. 
Speaking of Riot, he was such a poor villain. 90% of the movie he’s just walking around possessing people. Only showing up for the messy CGI finale. As a result the final fights lacks emotion weight. It’s just two different colored blobs going at each other. 
There’s no sense of time in the movie. How long have Anne and Eddie been broken up? Cuz it looks like she starts dating the doctor the very next day. How long has venom possessed Eddie? Do all the events of the movie happen over the course of a couple of nights? 

The writing and the plot are an absolute mess. It reminds me of comic movies pre marvel. Too loud and chaotic with poor writing and a paper thin plot. Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there haha. 
2018-10-06 03:29:07 I just loved it, the whole thing
2018-10-06 21:10:30 I'm shocked to say I actually enjoyed it. I can't really refute any of the complaints but Eddie/Venom with that bromance was enough to carry the movie for me. My description of the movie would be a likeable fun character carrying a basic bitch plot on his back.
My audience really liked it, people actually clapped at the ending to my continued surprise.

Eddie/Venom keeps me in the game, and the stuff around him is rarely too bad, just verrrrrry basic. It exists to give him things to react to. It's not a movie like Suicide Squad that just hurts for me to watch. The only character in this that ever sort of hurts to watch during the movie is Anne. (unless you count the mid credits scene, which is the worst shit ever)
Michelle Williams isn't fitting in and doesn't seem to know how she should act in the role. Everybody else kind of knows their place but she sticks out, zero chemistry with anyone around her. It's not entirely her acting, the writing for her character also seems to have no idea what to do with her. The character is dead weight and should have been cut.

My friend and I both agreed that if we went in blind we'd probably have had a harsher reaction. However going in with the frame of mind that we're probably about to see some funny trash, we ended up having a good time. It's trash but it's tasty trash. Unlike something like suicide squad which is just straight up spoiled milk.

And god damn that mid credits scene is bad.
2018-10-07 00:47:03 Just got out of the theater, and i really enjoyed it. It wasnt perfect, but it was a nice change of pace for a "super hero" movie. Really hope it does well so we can see that post-credits scene expanded upon in a sequel.
2018-10-07 01:50:22 I feel really bad for Tom Hardy because I can definitely see what he was talking about with footage being cut. Large parts were missing like building up their relationship or break up because it was very abrupt. Then there was probably a lot of stuff with them bonding. The moment of Venon becoming the hero felt super random.



I doubt the extra footage would make the film good, but it’s a shame.



That said, this is all avoidable by having a better script
2018-10-11 23:43:38 Screw the critics. I loved it. The writing needed a lot of work but overall I had a ton of fun watching it. Tom carried the movie. And the biggest reason I loved it: THEY DID VENOM JUSTICE. The fucking horrible job they did with Venom in Spiderman 3 was so infuriating. But this movie, the CGI was great, the voice, the moves....VERY happy how they did Venom. I look forward to seeing [Carnage!](#spoiler)
2018-10-05 06:20:09 Michelle William's ex-fiance character had some of the worst self preservation instincts I've ever seen on film.  She hears a SWAT team getting wiped out by a monster while firing a million billion bullets and smoke pouring outta everywhere, yet she still just walks in like "what's up?"
2018-10-05 07:17:33 If they get a new director, new writers and let it be rated R, there’s a lot of potential for the sequel. [Especially if Carnage appears early and frequently throughout the movie. My favorite part of this was the brief interaction between Venom and Riot. It’s a shame we probably won’t get to see any more symbiotes aside from Carnage.](#spoiler)
2018-10-05 13:39:48 I saw this in 3D tonight, because life is more interesting when you throw in the occasional bad decision.

Venom was shot pretty well and had nice SFX, but its story was deeply flawed, and its editing was so slapshot that it ended up being pretty mediocre. The RT 29% feels a bit low, Venom wasn't gratingly awful (well, maybe Tom Hardy's performance a little) but it's by no means a good movie. I'd put it more in the 40% range.

The story is really the weak-link in Venom. That four-man team tried to turn the Venom symbiote into a PG-13 xenomorph, and it never even came close to working. You'd think that a decade of Marvel movies sticking to the material would have ingrained the lesson, but team Venom missed it and straight-up made a comic book movie that fundamentally changed the characters it attempted to depict... which... why? Who's Venom for if not the comic book nerds?

**Other stray observations:**

* People keep telling me that Riz Ahmed is a good actor. Does he do anything other than stare vacantly with his huge eyes?
* Carlton Drake is a comically-bad name for an evil billionaire. Feels like it was workshopped to death. Another round of rewrites and he probably would have turned into Niles St. Poison.
* I legit thought that Jenny Slate's character was named Doris Girth until I saw her business card.
* How the fuck did they convince Woody to wear that wig?
2018-10-05 16:55:44 The first 20-30 minutes had terrible editing that made it feel like Suicide Squad. Everything after that was pretty good though. Once Eddie got the symbiote the movie became a solid 7/10. Not great, but definitely not a bad movie.
2018-10-05 18:15:03 I went in with extremely low expectations and because if this I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Definitely not a great movie but a fun one at least
2018-10-06 00:26:59 You know what, it was kinda garbage in a couple of ways. The writing is lacking and Jenny Slate was totally miscast, but it definitely isn’t as bad as everyone says it is. It’s very enjoyable and doesn’t take itself seriously enough to make it feel self-serious. Tom Hardy’s pretty good, the action is hella fun, and there are some moments that made my date say “stop laughing you’re being loud.” But everyone else around me was also laughing, including her,  so it’s all good. All in all, 6/10, total guilty pleasure and I’ll probably watch it again sometime.
2018-10-06 01:19:50 Am I the only one who was reminded of Turner & Hooch?
2018-10-06 03:12:48 The cuts during the fight scenes were terrible, and I think the premise could have been executed way better. [Why did we need a "super-bad guy symbiote" to fight anyway?](#spoiler)

Still what's here overall isn't terrible, it's especially not a sub-30% terrible movie as RT and most critical reviews led me to expect. Considering AMS2 is a 50+% film, and this film is at the very least as coherent as that mess, I think it's getting extra hate for nothing.

The post/mid-credits scene was a bit cheesy, and [how the hell can you do a movie with Carnage without it being R?](#spoiler).

It's a good movie to waste some time, but man did it get me wishing we had a horror-movie-esque take on Venom. There's an amazing movie to be made with this character.
2018-10-06 05:33:00 Way better than I expected. Enjoyed the movie more than the critics because I was having blast through the theater. I recommend it the cgi was great the jokes were ok and a little bit of romance that I didn’t get into but doesn’t ruin the movie by taking up an hour of it. I may be geek when it comes to marvel movies and might not give it what it actually deserves but Damn what an experience (coming from a genuine place in my heart) 4 out of 5 but what did you think? 
2018-10-06 07:59:54 Not nearly as bad as critics have put, i enjoyed it, solid 7
2018-10-06 08:51:53 Better than what the critics say. Not bad, at least a 6/10. I wonder how much better it could have been if Kevin Feige was fully involved with it.
2018-10-06 10:06:15 Yes, you’ve listed various aspects of a movie and said they were shit but a little detail would help
2018-10-06 10:37:12 It was better than I thought, I really liked the dynamic of the way venom and Eddie communicated. As someone who hasn’t read the comics and is absolutely unfamiliar with the venom lore outside of the spider-verse I really liked it since I had no baseline story wise. I’m really hoping we see a sequel with a refined and more effective duo. 

Something about this movie I enjoyed compared to other hero movies is that the jokes didn’t seem forced or that they were trying to hard. I would’ve enjoyed this more as an R film, with an anti hero vibe. If this took the path of Deadpool and Punisher venom would really take off. 
2018-10-07 06:07:38 That was a really fun movie.  The sequel with Woody Carnage is gonna be off the hook!
2018-10-07 09:02:47 I thought it was fucking awesome 
2018-10-07 10:34:40 Arriving home after watching it. Decent movie. I'm guessing the critics disliked it so much because it was your paint by numbers superhero first movie.  But I enjoyed the ride it took me on. Happily will pay for part two.
2018-10-07 10:40:37 It had it's flaws, but it wasn't nearly as bad as some people made it out to be. I had fun watching it, and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.

2018-10-08 03:33:24 ITT: People who didn't see Upgrade.

They're incredibly similar and Upgrade does it better IMHO. If the saving grace of Venom for you was the banter between Venom and Brock, then you'll LOVE Upgrade. And Upgrade is rated R.
2018-10-08 03:46:04 I honestly wasn't bored in any of the scenes, I guess every one is just missing a really good super hero flick for it to do so damn well at the Box Office, at any other time this might've been gutted horribly, but the window its in has pretty scarce competition all things considered.
2018-10-08 04:21:46 5/10, I don't think this dived into Catwoman levels bad and I can see why people think this is a good bad film, but this wasn't a good movie. Mediocre CG, tonal mess (90% of the jokes were cringey, jumping between horror, comedy, and romance?), bizarre creative choices (eating people, really?), and a lackluster ending final battle. Seemed very realistic for Michelle Williams' character to be so comfortable with a 13 foot alien symbiote killing and eating people right from the start. Did they also change out how Jenny Slate pronounced symbiote? 
2018-10-08 06:20:01 Carnage has been avoided from a lot of medium. Definitely Sony will have to resist treading lightly with this type of character and either go all in with an R rated Carnage movie or not do it at all.
2018-10-10 05:47:50 Saw it last night. I went in as a skeptic that I'd enjoy it, but I'll be damned if it didn't win me over. It was a very fun movie with some great effects and comedy. 

Definitely enjoyed. 
2018-10-10 18:38:55 If this film had been released in the early 90s it would now be looked back at with fondness, for being cheesyily bad, but with the modern Marvel logo tacked on at the head, and starring the very talented Tom Hardy, all I can say about this film is that it's a big disappointment.  Hardy swinging for the fences was the only thing that saved this film from being a complete garbage fire.
2018-10-12 21:50:40 What exactly is Sony trying to do here? Make a spider man universe without spider man? Now that the MCU has already used Vulture and about to film Homecoming 2 with Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, the amount of good Spider man villains is probably gonna dry up in a few years. Either way the movie was a mess, even though there was some pretty funny moments between Tom Hardy and the weird CGI black thing, character motivations didn't make sense (e.g: What was Riz Ahmed's character trying to do? I know he was trying to like send people into space with the symbiotes but why not just study them? You've literally just discovered Alien life!) Eddie Brock doesn't really change in the movie (It might have been interesting to see them experiment with his sense of morality but he just tells venom not to bite people's heads off the entire movie) and tonally its all over the place \[What does it want to be? Action? Horror? Comedy? One minute Venom's calling him a pussy for not jumping out the window, next he's fighting a swat team, next he's in a car with his ex and now he's sadddd :'( \] Wouldn't recommend unless you're a hardcore Spider man/Tom Hardy fan. Whatever Sony's trying to create here, I already don't like it
2018-10-05 11:21:10 Is no one else bothered by the fact that they spent a large part of the movie talking about how difficult it was to find a suitable host for the symbiotes, but then Venom happens to match with Brock’s girlfriend and a random dog at a hospital?
2018-10-18 05:21:14 This movie was excellent and entertaining as well. Venom is officially my favorite villian
2018-10-05 19:47:16 The critics are completely wrong.

I went in with low expectations, and I thought it was fine. It's just a fun time at the movies. Yeah sure, the plot wasn't great and the editing kind of choppy bordering on non-sensical, but I had fun time. 

The dialogue wasn't great but that added to the fun. I thought Halle Berry was well cast and I liked how camp it all was. Who cares if it's not very deep? That fight with Sharon Stone was just fun, you have to hate fun to not like this movie. I give Catwoman at least a 7/10, check it out, just leave your brain at the door!
2018-10-05 06:12:16 Not nearly as bad as people were making it out to be. It was actually kind of fun. Shades of “Upgrade” with the Venom/Eddie relationship. 

Would watch a sequel. 
2018-10-05 07:00:45 It's fascinating just how every person in here except Tom looks like they *hate* being there. It's kind of hilaripus in fact,

And now Tom hates it too!
2018-10-05 07:50:05 Goat movie 
2018-10-05 09:04:39 I thought it was very fun. Definitely enjoyed it. 
2018-10-05 09:07:53 Venom-bro and eddie brock was the part of the whole movie, the elevator scene and venom being invested in his love life were the highlights for me. 
2018-10-05 09:28:41 I thought it wasn’t as bad as critics were saying it was, but it still wasn’t a great movie. Lots of things made me cringe and just shake my head, but lots of things I feel were also pretty well done. Once Eddie actually gets venom the movie actually becomes pretty fun to watch. I wasn’t a huge fan of how they tried to make venom the “comedic relief”, but it wasn’t all that bad. Overall, I didn’t feel like I wasted my time seeing this movie but there is a lot that needs to be improved if they are gonna commit to this franchise. 
2018-10-05 09:41:04 It was a fun movie, nothing amazing and nothing super terrible like everyone is trying to say. Only problem I really had was the villain actor wasn't that good and the fact that the last scene is spoiled in the trailer
2018-10-05 10:23:00 You know I enjoyed it I hope they have more venom Eddie brock buddy cop stuff in the sequel it was kinda fun.
2018-10-05 11:15:51 I didn’t realize independent extortion was such a problem in San Francisco
2018-10-05 18:02:39 I was blinded by that laptop, when the screen switched to the dark room and then focused again on the laptop screen. When Brock was looking into his ex's ties with Life Foundation.
2018-10-05 18:05:06 It isn't the best but if you can catch a cheap showing it certainly has its own charm.
2018-10-05 18:12:13 I felt the movie was pretty average, The Venom and Hardy duo is probably the best part, very well done there.
2018-10-05 20:14:38 I want the new RTJ song now!
2018-10-06 05:09:15 I enjoyed it, felt it was decently funny with the talk between Hardy/Venom. Overall, it was a fun movie.

The only things I felt stood out negatively is the editing. Unless I blacked out at some point, there felt like pieces of the story were missing. Like his ex-fiance broke up with him and then a few scenes later she's in a committed relationship with some other guy. Was there a "6 months later" card I missed? Or did the story travel in two timelines and converge at that point?
2018-10-06 05:34:49 What was the second post credit scene? I left after the first one. 
2018-10-06 08:38:51 Apparently Dan Egan isn't with Selina anymore, didn't know he had a medical license though.
2018-10-06 09:17:34 A lot of times I end up enjoying movies that get bad reviews. This was a fun ride. Just sit back and enjoy it lol
2018-10-06 09:18:48 Great Superman Punch from Eddie at the end 
2018-10-07 00:31:54 Wait I don't get it .. Why do some symbiotes come out of the body and die when rejected,by the host, but venom and the other one just hop into all hosts ??
2018-10-07 02:22:59 I'd like to see Eddie Brock walk into a dinner meeting between Patrick Bateman and Vampire's Kiss Cage, at the Dorsia. 
2018-10-07 19:10:20 It was a movie where you could go in a switch off. So 'fun' by definition and that's all I'll give it. Not exactly bad but the story was lacking.

One thing that I noticed were that nearly all scenes were very short. Anyone else notice this? 
2018-10-08 03:14:22 Just came back from the theatre. Did Anne have an accent in the beginning that disappeared after she dated the doctor?
2018-10-08 10:02:28 Is anyone here in the news industry? Are there reasons why a news agency would send an investigative reporter to do a 'puff piece'? I always got the impression that the news business wasn't lacking reporters, and to choose Eddy for that assignment seemed like a serious mis-match. That part of the script made no sense to me, and along with Eddy's prompt firing - I feel like the boss man was looking for ways to fire Eddy, but the movie didn't show any background about this.

2018-10-09 03:23:13 I found Tom Hardy's portrayal a bit weird, but then I figured he was trying to channel Bill Weir, with his "I sound drunk, but I'm not really drunk" style reporter.
2018-10-09 07:34:39 Was it ever explained how exactly Eddie changed Venom? He said he was the cause of his change of heart, was it something in particular Eddie did?
2018-10-09 13:24:26 I enjoyed it, but I think an R-Rating would definitely have done the movie good. 

I also think the start as "investigative reporter" could have been interesting, if they went anywhere with it. Instead, the moment his career hits the Evil Elon Musk roadblock, he stops. I would have imagined him having a bit more agency and not needing someone to come out to get him back in the game. It kinda makes this part of his backstory and personality irrelevant. Instead of that, it might have been a lot more fun if he had found the Symbiote earlier and we would have gotten more time together with Venom. 

&#x200B;

And of course, the end fight is a nice CGI fest, but kinda lame. Since the villains are mostly one-dimensional and the Symbiote powers and resilience are kinda arbitrary for the viewer, there is nothing actually relatable happening there - you have neither a conflict of personality, nor real empathy due to a visceral fight where youcan  feel with every blow. It's a common problem with superhero movies, unfortunately. (I'd say the MCU has been the most succesful in avoiding this in some of its movies ,but they aren't perfect at it, either.)
2018-10-11 03:40:58 I went to go see it and before I even buy the ticket, the lady asks for my ID. I thought this was no longer a pg13 movie, so I got excited that it was now rated R. Got my ticket said pg13 anyway 😭 so I watch the film and I'm on the fence about the movie. There wasn't enough time to get enough character development from Venom and the Villian. I was sad that the movie ended so soon, and the fact that Venom flipped sides waaay too quick. I loved Eddie and Venom's interactions, but it was something seriously lacking in the movie. I think everything happened so quickly that I couldn't connect with our characters, especially Venom. I think this could all be due to the potential rumors that a lot of people are saying they switched ratings right at the end. So once they did that they cut like 40 min or so from the final film. So who knows 🤷‍♀️
2018-10-12 13:19:04 > Yes, but only if there's graphic sex scenes

41.09% (1,513)

*Nice*

2018-10-12 15:52:20 It was fun I guess. It reminded me a lot of Upgrade (it was only recently screened in my country) which was a movie I quite enjoyed so. Not the next big thing or whatever but I had a good time nonetheless. I especially liked how the pacing was fast and they didn't spend too much time on useless stuff.
2018-10-13 11:28:57 >*The filmmakers cite the films of horror directors* [*John Carpenter*](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118) *and* [*David Cronenberg*](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343) *as an influence on the film, as well as the horror comedy films* [*An American Werewolf in London*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010) *(1981) and* [*Ghostbusters*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332) *(1984).*  \- imdb trivia

**NONE Of This Ever Happens!**
2018-10-13 16:35:30 Hard to believe other territories are screening this PG-13 with additional edits! Markets in Italy and Malaysia (essentially anywhere the distributors had to go back and render all of the Title Cards Overlays so they’re legible to that audience) also have government ratings boards. The studio has very little time to re-submit their revised movie for a new ratings classification, so most times they’ll instruct the post house to send them an *”Airline (in-flight) Print.”* 

This blanket censorship film is rarely challenged. And A Lot gets tossed, simply because they need the equivalent to our PG rating, to get past their censors; Even the questionable content, like when Anne/She-Venom and Eddie hard Full-mouthful-smash kiss in the woods,


2018-10-15 10:37:42 A little rough in parts, but enjoyable flick, had a good bunch of chuckles. Enjoyed seeing Hardy build Brock, pre-Venom. Relationship between Venom and Brock felt a little rushed. Ending action sequences were a little fast and dark, some decisions were made to squeeze the film in 2 hours. Hopefully there's a full cut feature release in the future.

&#x200B;

Edit: Really didn't like the wig.
2018-10-20 18:33:06 I haven't seen it, but I have seen reviews and it makes me wonder what Marvel does right that others don't?
2018-11-28 18:12:28 Enjoyed it, not necessarily a good Venom movie, but a good movie, really like the new take on Venom being a pouty demon parasite baby
2018-10-05 08:27:42 I thought it was good. Not great, nor the abysmal film that the media seems to be making it out to be. I actually enjoyed myself quite a bit.
2018-10-05 11:20:28 It did not deserve the lashings it got from the reviews but a part of me is glad it got them I walked into the cinema expecting the worst film this year but instead got a highly enjoyable version of venom. Highly recommended it's not going to change the world of cinema but its really really fun. 
2018-10-17 07:30:21 I kinda agree with the Critics on this one. I thought the movie as a whole was just awful. The story line was OK but it could of been done so much better. The movie itself just looked like a music video. CGI was poor, pacing was all over the place, too much exposition then plot holes that contradict that exposition. The end movie is basically the trailer they used. And I'm not sure if blood was edited from the movie but damn could you tell there should of been some sort moments that looked very doctored. The head biting, when Riot merced everyone in that room, just too many scenes. That Eminem song is garbage too. Did not fit into it at all. 
2018-10-05 19:26:43 Critics destroy movie on everything prior to release to public. Then we go in with low expectations and have a good time. Was not disappointed, very pleased. Looking forward to Venom 2 with Carnage. 
2018-10-10 20:48:18 I expect it to be shit so it might helped,but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the movie. 
The plot makes no sense, the dialogue is awkward as hell, but it is so consistently bad at some point you go “screw it” and laugh at any shit it throws at you.
Excellent viewing experience. Would recommend going in drunk.
2018-10-06 08:30:00 Okay so this will likely get buried in the other comments, but if you read this, please help this get to the top because the reviews don’t do this movie justice.

I think this movie is good. Granted I’m pleased fairly easily, but I genuinely do not think this movie is nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be. I saw this with two friends and they agree. So lemme just rattle off some thoughts.

_**Spoilers.**_

**Pros:**

- Tom Hardy is really good in this movie and this is one of my more favorite roles by him, possibly only behind Inception and TDKR. He does a great job conveying slight insanity and fear, as well as having funny moments.

- Speaking of which, this movie actually has plenty of laughs from the theater, Venom and Brock have a great chemistry, and lots of jokes play into them. Along with that the humor isn’t slapstick or gross-out humor and actually has thought put into it.

- I understood both Brock and Venom fine. They both were completely understandable, way more than TDKR Bane. Also the trailers don’t do the dialogue justice, I didn’t find many, if any cringe moments. Not even the turd.

- Other than a few of the villains and some bystanders, I gave a shit about Brock, Venom, Ann, and her boyfriend. They rush some stuff early on, but throughout the movie I genuinely was interested in them.

- Special effects are good. At least, I personally think so. The symbiotes looked good, and were distinguishable from each other.

- That chase sequence was insane.

- Woody Harrelson.

- Whoever said that the Symbiote only appears in the last few minutes is completely fucking lying. Several scenes with Brock using symbiote tendrils and shit, and plenty of full venom scenes. You hear venom a ton too.

- She-Venom.

**Cons:**

- I didn’t give a fuck about Drake. There wasn’t any backstory that gave him any understandability. I didn’t agree with him or feel like he had a reason to be the way he is. He’s a dick because he’s a dick. Plus he isn’t that bad of villain in terms of horrific acts. Yeah, some test subjects die and he murders some scientists, but nothing made me go like “OH SHIT” like Thanos, or Axel (DP), etc.

- Rest of the villians were moronic and made dumbass choices. Not a competent one in the bunch. Drake included. Carnage needs to fix this.

- Lady doctor gets shafted so hard and she doesn’t get avenged or nothing. Her family could be dead now and I don’t know or necessarily care.

- Pacing was weird. Here’s Brock/oh shit he fucks up and loses his job and his wife/6 months later/now he’s sad. Gimme a little time or some extra scenes to let that shit sink in.

- Why did that riot in the lady take so long to get to Drake? Go full symbiote and get there in a week.

- Ann separates Venom from Brock when it’s revealed that Venom is rotting Brock’s organs. They join again later. Twice. It’s never brought up again. Even a line that expresses that Venom eating people counteracts this would’ve been sufficient.

- Final fight scene was shaky cam slightly. Not Resident Evil bad, but it wasn’t no John Wick or Captain America.

- Also the fight was quick as fuck.

- Rated-R would’ve been nicer. It was still good, but a rated-R would’ve made a slightly nicer movie.

- woody harrelson’s wig

**Overall:**

- The movie itself? 7/10. How much I enjoyed it? 8-9/10. It was funny, the characters were good (xcept’ drake) and I’m down for a sequel. Make Carnage dope, make it rated r, fix the pacing and make the movie longer. I don’t think Sony should give up. I’ll buy the 4K Steelbook.

Also She-Venom makes me hot and bothered.


Edit: Adding things as I remember them.
2018-10-06 18:32:13 Holy shit, this one was a ride

That first part of the movie really dragged in the beginning but by the time he first transforms, I was completely hooked.

The special effects were insanely good and the motorcycle chase through San Francisco was one of the coolest fucking things I’ve seen all year.

The exact moment they showed the prison in the after credits sequence, *I lost my shit*

Woody *Motherfucking* Harrelson as Carnage, now that is something I did not expect. The sequel is really going to need an R rating if they want to take full advantage of the character.
2018-10-05 06:09:33 A turd in the wind
2018-10-05 06:10:38 Man, who keeps letting Avi Arad make comic book movies?
2018-10-05 07:25:24 Anyone find it kinda weird how they mentioned kryptonite in this?
2018-10-05 07:37:11 I honestly enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would from the reviews and trailers. I was mostly surprised by the performances. Tom Hardy's voice wasn't as distracting as in the trailer at all, and I thought he was genuinely really funny at times. Without him, this whole movie would fall apart. I really liked what he did with this role, he brings a fantastic energy to the movie.
Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate were both good (although Michelle Williams's character was pretty pointless), and Riz Ahmed did a decent job of being both likeable and creepy at the same time. It was pretty violent for a PG-13 movie (when that test patient's bones started breaking all over I winced), but could have benefitted from an R-Rating sometimes. It didn't ruin the movie for me though.

It's really funny as well, I laughed a lot during this movie as it gets pretty crazy at times. I also enjoyed the action, in the first two acts at least. The motorbike chase in the middle was well done and the two fight scenes before and after that scene were also pretty rad (the score in those scenes got me pumped too). Unfortunately the big third act fight was quite bad. Two CGI characters jumping all over the place in dark lighting with a shaky camera? I'm usually pretty forgiving towards bloated CGI third acts but this one was especially boring to me.

The biggest problem of this movie is the script though. It has some pretty laughable dialogue and the story is a little ridiculous at times. The thread about the rocket about to take off was incredibly poorly set up. All of a sudden Venom was a good guy? And the story really didn't flow well towards that final action scene. When they started fighting I was like "wait, we're at the big final fight already?". I'm not exactly sure what it was but it really felt out of place.

Overall I'd give it about a 7/10, maybe a little lower because of that third act. It's a shame that this movie could've been so much better with a decent screenplay. It had a lot of potential (great cast), and now the final result was pretty forgettable to me. And I'm so disappointed in Sony for giving away the final scene of their movie AGAIN, after getting so much hate for doing that with TASM2. Oh well, now at least I could prepare myself for that "turd in the wind" line.

And that end credits scene reminded me of how much more hyped I am for Into the Spider-Verse.
2018-10-05 12:01:39 It was better than I expected, doesn't deserve to be put in the same category as Suicide Squad.

Only thing I really didn't like was how suddenly Venom was on Team Humans? Like it wasn't explained at all. I'm sure the 40 minutes that were cut probably elaborated on that more.
2018-10-05 13:40:22 It is a lot of fun. The whole audience was laughing but not for the right reasons, but hey it was a good laugh. Venom from my childhood was always big and dumb and Tom Hardy kinds brought that side of it more. He should do more comedy as him just attempting meditation got some laughs. . 

Really wish it was 18 and they exploited more body horror as it could have been more of a re-animator style movie. Since they put in some mad scientist themes in there but never really used it fully in a horror comedy sense (seeing as the films positives was how funny/goofy it was). Also it felt more like a Sam Raimi film in places that spiderman-3 did. 

Downside/negatives: The overall plot and character motivations is a mess and very generic. Like other reviews said it feels like a superhero movie from 10-15 years ago and they followed the basic 'hero origin story tick boxes' from omg I got powers, to winning back a lost love, to a boss fight ending. Sadly the big villain fight at the end is a flop too as something they wanted to be a finale to everything. I thought the car chase at the beginning was more interesting than the cgi-fest of the end. 

If they did a Deadpool and handed this over some creative control to Tom Hardy and others who could really go wild with the characters it could be great. 

To note: The end credit scene was a surprise and weird casting wise and someone needs to re-cut it where he meets Charles Bronson instead. 


2018-10-07 00:27:19 This was much better than I expected based on the reviews. Legitimately enjoyed the venom persona 
2018-10-07 00:44:50 Reading these comments reminds me of  the "Bright" situation where critics trashed the movie and reddit was bashing the critics heavily for it so I kinda went into it with so-so expectations and really hated it. Everything about the movie except the setting was awful. I want to watch Venom, but the divide in these comments aint looking good and it's giving me the same vibe.
2018-10-08 04:37:14 Upgrade did it better
2018-10-05 09:55:42 Gotta say it, enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Critics have been giving it a hard time. It was a not a very good movie. But it didn't deserve so much hate from critics. 
2018-10-06 01:04:16 I was really surprised when people clapped at the end of the movie. I'm glad the movie was over too, but it seemed kind of inappropriate.

And they really should stick to one pronunciation of of symbiote. It seems like every other scene has a different way of saying it. My skin crawls whenever I hear *sim-be-yolk* or whatever.
2018-10-07 01:34:28 Wasn’t going to pay to see it in the theater but I clicked on this thread last night to see if it was worth watching at all and saw the positive reviews. Just saw it and thought it was great. Worth it!
2018-10-11 03:57:08 So i saw this movie like 2 hours ago. And if i'm really honest, I loved it. My boyfriend and I were both just enjoying the movie in all its glory.  I know there are some spots, and holes. But at the end of the day its just a 2 hour fun ride to relax after a hard day (Tom Hard day :P ) in the real world. So maybe just watch the movie relaxed open minded and chill from the real world for a bit. Tom's performance should be enough, **he was golden!** 
2018-10-29 03:30:24 That was pretty good yeah? I'd say it's better than a fair chunk of the MCU movies. I'd put it ahead of Thor and Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 and even age of Ultron. 
2018-10-05 11:21:49 Watched it on the front row for free with no expectations in a theatre full of college students that got free tickets. Also two guys next to me definitely smoked weed right before.

I fucking loved it.
2018-10-05 17:41:15 I don’t get why people are shitting on it a lot. Yeah it has quite a slow start and then a very sudden rush near the end but it’s really not a bad movie. I assume we’re getting a second movie due to a credits cutscene of some insane bloke mentioning Carnage.
2018-10-07 00:34:23 Holy hell I enjoyed this movie. Honestly one of the most entertaining movies I’ve seen this year. The beginning dragged a bit and Anne’s character did not have enough characterization but other than that nothing really took away enjoyment from me. I totally understand why people wouldn’t like this movie and I understand a lot of the critics views on this movie, but Tom Hardy carries this movie. Some moments he’s batshit insane and other moments he’s really showing a lot of emotion and fun. Really loved his performance. Again, I could totally understand how people couldn’t get past his voice but it worked for me.

Venom (the character) was really nowhere near how he is in the comics. (Spolierish territory here) Venom is only kind of evil, but he has hilarious banter with Tom hardy. My favorite aspect of the movie really. They actually did a pretty good job of the horror aspect in the beginning, but they shy away from that near the end. I’d want a sequel to focus on this more. 

The action is so so. It has two solid to good actions scenes in the beginning, but the last one is really hard to follow but if you like seeing two big aliens fighting each other you will still find some enjoyment. They also push the envelope a little bit with the PG-13 violence, but the movie would have definitely be better with an R rating to show how gruesome Venom is. I hope a sequel will be rated R an lean into this aspect more. But even though there was no R rated violence, the movie did a good job showing the symbiotes do some fucked up things. 

The villain really isn’t explained that well and is just kinda evil to be evil. He does have his reasons, but it’s just a little too on the nose. And it follows the trope of the hero just fights a bigger badder version of himself. 

The climax is pretty contrived and doesn’t have enough set up, but it makes enough sense to not take away too much from the film for me personally. 

I don’t normally give theses movies a pass if the story isn’t great and we get into the whole movie circle jerk “fun time, fuck the critics” aspect but I just had a blast watching this. So I’d say give this movie a chance, if you are into fun action movies because I think this movies definitely owns that aspect. This movie is not great, but it is a fun time at the movies if that’s what you are looking for. But if you are looking for a marvel studios level of polish and a dark knight level of seriousness, this movie doesn’t have it. 
2018-10-05 08:17:49 Not a good movie. Not a good super hero movie. Tons of shit had terrible plot holes.






  But I had fun 
2018-10-05 11:02:42 I definitely think the review scores I've seen for this movie were very heavy handed. I would watch this over Catwoman, BvS, Justice League, or Thor The Dark World any day. I think it's on par with Iron Man 2. Solid movie that has it's moments. I personally would give it a 7-7.5/10 
2018-10-05 16:37:13 Aite, unpopular opinion...

I loved watching this movie! I think it was an absolutely thrilling ride, and I found myself engrossed in it for almost every minute of the way. It was dark in a DC way, but not *boring* dark, and was funny as well.

What I didn't like: they demystified Venom a lot. Went into the movie thinking of Venom as this dark, mysterious creature, and it's revealed that he's a loser on his home planet, and is apparently super sentimental, and becomes a glorified pet. Tons of plot holes, too... like why the fuck does Venom have to ask Eddie any questions at all? He's in his head ffs.

What I did like: fantastic acting! And, well, it was really fun.
2018-10-08 14:17:14 What a terrible, cynically made film. It's like an early 2000s Marvel film, down to exact plot beats. Worse still, this whole film is a rip off of the Eddie Murphy comedy "Meet Dave".

Both feature aliens who inhabit a human host in order to blend in, all the while planning a mission to invade Earth. In Meet Dave, they want to steal Earth's water, in Venom, Riot wants to bring more symbiotes to Earth so they can take over living hosts. Both feature aliens who eventually betray the big bad guy aliens and help humanity defeat them. Both feature aliens getting used to the human form and trying to survive in it. Both feature comedic parts where aliens aren't acting like real people, much to the confusion of others. It's the same fucking film and it's hilarious.

Tom Hardy is awful. He keeps slipping in and out of his accent, and nearly all of his interactions are silly and hilarious in different ways. The lobster tank scene and the scene where he's talking to Drake's lab assistant stand out as the funniest parts of the film. I liked Riz Ahmed, but his dialogue is fucking terrible. Also, Venom's motivations are unclear and the whole 3rd act feels really rushed and chopped up. There's no suspense at all, Venom just decides he likes Earth so decides to go fight Riot. There are several sequences throughout the film where you can tell they cut it down to get it under 2 hours to accommodate more showtimes. That's embarassingly cynical.

Honestly, the film is a shambles and even if it isn't as bad as Truth or Dare or even Slender Man, Venom is dogshit, even if the first half is hysterically funny because of how bad it is.
2018-10-05 06:11:22 I think the biggest winners from all of this are the Eddie/Venom fanfic writers.
2018-10-05 06:37:10 I was very meh about the first part of it but as soon as the Venom personality started talking it was leaps and bounds better.  The trailers made me dislike Eddie quite a bit (and I'm not a huge Tom Hardy fan) but he grew on me and I ended up liking him too.
2018-10-05 07:00:30  I grew up with Spider-man TAS and reading the comics and I thought it was pretty solid. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I really liked how John Jameson was the surviving astronaut from the crash at the beginning and I thought it was interesting that they mentioned Eddie being "run out" of New York before the movie started. Maybe they could (or wanted to if the movie was successful) tie in Spider-man later through that. I thought Eddie and the symbiote's banter was great. As well as the She-Venom reference. I'd give it a solid 7. The biggest problem I had was Cletus Kassidy's "When I get out, there's gonna be CARNAGE!" which was way too on the nose for me. 
2018-10-05 07:48:22 The comedy was the best part of the whole movie 
2018-10-05 07:57:03 I enjoyed it! It was cheesy as fuck but the Venom action scenes were pretty rad. 

One fight in particular was pretty much what ive been wanting since spiderman 3
2018-10-05 13:40:07 I saw it last night. Spoilers ahead.

I think they got Eddie Brock pretty right. An angry, down on his luck guy (because of his own mistakes), who shirks responsibility and doing good. But who is at his core good. 

Although it's weird to have Eddie Brock without a Peter Parker style adversary. One whom he and venom bond over.

I liked venom as a character too. He was dark, but light hearted. Didn't care about human life, but didn't needlessly kill. He and Brock seemed like a good fit. 

Probably the most important thing about this movie, from a fan's perspective, is that character(s). And I think they got it right.

I also really liked his powers. How they seemed reflexive and symbiote-y. It's a shame the symbiote didn't bond with Spiderman first, so we don't have the web swinging, or the symbol. 

My issues with the movie are mostly pace, tone, and villain.

The pace seemed really slow at the start. (Except around the crash survivor, and the ambulance leaving, and when riot crashes the ambulance. That was quick!) Really slow setting up his personal and professional life. But then really quick when he got dumped! Seemed to come out of nowhere with no conversation! I thought maybe they could start the movie post time jump. Start with the villains and symbiotes, they go to a depressed and stressed Eddie and explain his backstory without painful exposition. The pace leveled out after he got infected.

The tone was creepy and horror-y at the start. Then standard down-on-his-luck protagonist. Then really dark as the villain just seemed keen on killing people! He's supposed to be smart, why does he not understand the value of slow scientific study! And keeping his workers happy! Eddie escaping the facility was comedic and goofy. Him eating at home was meant to be funny (it wasn't). The fight was well choreographed. Then it got fun, as Eddie leant more about himself. The tone leveled out more towards the end.

And the villain! At no point in the whole movie, did he ever seem competent! He was a man baby that liked punishing people. He was an idiot. And an incompetent villain is never scary. Hopefully funny, but never scary. And he wasn't funny. Hmm, he seemed incredibly capable fighting all my armed men with no weapon. I know, I'll send more men! And explode-y drones! (What the fuck were they supposed to do?! And on a public street? Probably killing civilians. Did we see any repercussions for the villain tearing up a public street? Maybe those swat guys coming after venom. Did we see any repercussions for venom tearing up those swat guys? No. And why didn't venom just tear up the rocket first, then fight riot.

Some bad writing. "My-my legs! I can walk! They were broken, but now I can walk!" Yeah we know! We saw it happen. When he swings into the apartment, smashes a window. Immediately someone says, "dude how did you do that!" Like, really? Half a second after someone smashes a window with their body you're asking how? You had a controller in your hand, you were playing a video game. You were not watching out the window.

Oh yeah, also some bad continuity. Lots of scenes where the background changed between shots. Very distracting.

So; bad villain, no sense of real threat.

Weird mismatched tone.

Painfully and obviously odd pace (at least at the start).

Lots of little things I liked in this movie though. Michelle Williams was good. Dan and Eddie's relationship seemed realistic and pretty nice to see. 

And good core character. Especially considering there's no Peter Parker or Spiderman in this world.
2018-10-05 16:57:39 Near the end of the film when Eddie and Venom destroyed the rocket ship launch and the explosion that killed Riot, Venom says, "Goodbye, Eddie", but then it's shown that Venom is still inside Eddie literally in the next scene. That part seemed very confusing to me and I'm not really sure why they kept that in. Maybe I missed something.
2018-10-05 17:12:47 Hey guys what trailers played before your screening?!
2018-10-06 00:01:34 My fav part is fem venom kissing eddie. Pretty hot tbh. 
2018-10-06 01:56:16 Let it be said I'm no die-hard Venom fan (I've a rather pedestrian familiarity with the character) so how that impacts my views on the film, I'll let you decide: but I'd be lying if I said I hated it.             In fact I found myself actually digging it quite a good lot.      Hardy works well in the role of Brock, the internal monologue with Venom was cute, I also enjoyed the SFX work for the symbiotes.        [Yes, we have *another* suit to add to the bin of generic supervillains but the ***biggest*** gripe I had was the fight scene cinematography.         If I had to pin it, it *seemed* to be going for something of a Kingsman vibe: continual, fast-paced oners; but it felt so poorly executed here.             It was especially bad in the final confrontation between Venom and Riot, while I could easily blame on it the lack of real estate the scene confided them to prior tiffs like the SWAT Fight seemed to be a similar problem.          I don't know where it falls flat and what about it Kingsman does better but compare the fights in Kingsman like the Church Massacre to some of the fights in Venom maybe it'll speak for itself.](#spoiler)
2018-10-06 02:30:21 You know what, I really liked it! It was silly but dark and the funniness wasn't gag heavy (which is the side of Deadpool films I don't like) 
2018-10-06 03:12:50 Question - does Venom unmask a lot in this movie? One of my biggest problems with all Spider-Man movies is that he always unmasks himself. In Spider-Man 3, Venom doesn't even get much face time - he always unmasks himself to show that doofus' face.
2018-10-06 03:34:44 Riot is what you would call a team leader.  
This makes me what to see more riot as the little girl killing people to get to drake.
2018-10-06 07:03:51 The movie was fun. Once I got over the fact this was Venom without Spiderman it was ok. Well not really, as a film fan it was poorly edited but boy did it look BEAUTIFUL. Some of the best cinematography in a superhero film ever. They really captured the ambiance of San Francisco and the woods looked awesome. The mist, everything. The effects when Venom is only partially visible are top notch but when the symbiotes appear in full then it gets problematic. When the symbiotes fought I felt I was watching Transformers 1. It was pretty bad how much you couldn't see shit. That said, Tom Hardy made this movie cool. He was awesome as Eddie Brock AND as the voice of Venom. I left wanting to see a sequel so it wasn't a terrible film. Nice little nod at the end. Too bad no Spiderman or they could adapt Maximum Carnage. 
2018-10-06 07:09:27 No one seems to be mentioning when Annie asks Eddie if certain sound frequencies are "like it's kryptonite" when referring to Venom's weakness. Just opening the door for that DC vs Sony-Marvel crossover.
2018-10-06 08:38:08 So Annie asked Brock if the sound frequency was like Venom’s “kryptonite.” Does that mean that Superman, or at least Superman comics, exists that universe?
2018-10-06 10:35:29 Really enjoyed this movie. Came in with super low expectations due to the scores, but walked out the cinema with a smile.
2018-10-06 12:36:07 Decided to repost my thoughts here.

I watched, it's a pretty under average movie. The best parts of the movie was Tom Hardy's really campy performance as not just Eddie Brock but Venom, once those two are working together, does the movie get much more entertaining. The movie could've easily just cut out the first 3rd of the story IMO. Also should've been rated R instead of this pretty meh pg13 flick.

The story is pretty much cliched if you've seen tons of superhero movies and the only part I found unexpected was the location of where the movie would start at but other than that, entirely predictable. Follows beat by beat. IMO it reminded of Tobey Macguire's first Spider-man movie but done much worse. The writing needed alot more reworking. There's a romance aspect that was utterly utterly forgettable too.

Action was decent aside from one hard to follow CGI battle and one chase scene that dragged on waay too much IMO. Speaking of CG, I'm kinda disappointed that a good looking Venom is wasted in a Sonyverse marvel movie instead of the MCU, man, he looks just what I'd imagine Venom would be, unlike that Spider-man 3 crap.

Overall, 2/5 to me. If you like Venom the character and Tom Hardy, you're probably gonna like this movie. Also stay for the 2 post credits scenes, both great teasers of future movies, one that I can assure is looking to be so much better than Venom IMO.
2018-10-06 13:54:27 They actually did She-Venom!

And what the fuck, I thought they would showcase all the 5 Life Foundation symbiotes! We only got to see Riot in his full glory, and we got to see Scream’s symbiote and host separately.

As a Venom fan, I liked the callbacks to the comics.

But apart from all of that, this movie was a total dud.

God, just reunite Venom, Black Cat, Silver Sable, Kraven, Morbius and the rest of the Spider-Verse with the rest of the Marvel characters on the big screen!
2018-10-07 01:31:28 I liked it. I think if this had been a prototype movie with minor changes people would say it's a good video game movie as opposed to a bad superhero movie.
2018-10-07 17:21:27 It was fun. its like an early 2000-2005 scifi movie. really had fun
2018-10-08 04:55:40 It wasn't horrible. It was pretty meh. Without spider-man the movie would have benefited from another 30 mins of fleshing out Eddie and Venom's relationship before jumping into the final fight. It went from Venom appearing and going straight to final boss mode. 
2018-10-08 11:37:23 "What are we, some kinda carnage?"
2018-10-09 16:52:06 I actually enjoyed it once Eddie and venom became one. Before that it was awful. 
2018-10-10 07:37:08 What i think, the first 25-30 min of the movie blows. tom hardy is awesome in it. i dont know what hes supposed to be exactly but hes entertaining. once eddie and venom start interacting the movie massively jumps up. its pretty damn funny, which is weird. villian is forgettable and cliche. love interest forgettable and cliche. cgi is 2005-esq. the best way i can describe it is a buddy-cop rom com featuring drunk tom hardy and his alien partner and i want more of them

Edit: this message was provided Oreida ® 
2018-10-14 23:05:28 Just got back from the theater. It was a pretty fun movie and was nowhere near as bad as people made it out to be. Sure, the plot was basic, but I loved the action and how they made the symbiotes really seem real. The sounds and look of them were pretty great.
2018-10-05 06:24:00 Once again, watch Upgrade instead.
2018-10-05 06:05:07 Venom calling Eddie a pussy was great. I loved how their relationship developed throughout the movie
2018-10-05 10:17:26 So bad reviews everywhere except r/movies? Hmm
2018-10-07 03:52:28 This movie is basicaly The Incredible Hulk, but funny.

1. Main Guy running away with powers gotten in a lab while the owners of the lab tries to capture him to weaponise the powers

2. Main Guy was in a relationship with someone who works for the people who want to capture Main Guy

3. Main Guy loses relationship after getting powers

4. Main Guy is constantly trying to get rid of his powers

5. Main Guy temporarily gets rid of powers

6. A henchman of the guys trying to capture them has a personal vendetta against main guy

7. Bad Guy gets the same powers as Main Guy

8. Main Guy gets powers back just in time to fight Bad Guy

9. Main Guy vs Bad Guy fight thats painful to watch

10. Main Guy wins in the end

11. Main Guy comes to terms with his powers

12. While using Powers, Main Guy isnt in full control

13. A popular enemy of Main Guy is teased for future movies which will probably never happen

14. Post Credit scene is just an advert for another movie with no direct connection to this one

Wake up sheeple
2018-10-07 19:10:25 I give it a 6/10. My random thoughts that I mentioned elsewhere:

Venom Random Thoughts:

*Wasn't expecting this to be a comedy, but it had genuine funny moments and moments that I wasn't supposed to laugh at but did (like The Room).

*Tom Hardy is decent as both Eddie Brock and the Venom voice. The interplay between the two characters actually works.

*Not much of a plot. Long stretch in the first 30 minutes where a lot happens yet nothing happens as a consequence. 

*Evil Elon Musk just doesn't work as a villain. Just too one note.

*The CGI looks great at times and...not so great. It's a mixed bag.

*The Venom makeout scene is just as silly as I heard it was.

*Plot holes do exist here, mainly about how Venom is affected by sounds and sonic booms.

*SPOILERS........*Woody Harrelson doesn't look like Cletus Kassidy/Carnage. He looks like Woody Harrelson cosplaying as a guy cosplaying as Kassidy.

*The guy behind me yelling "Did he just eat his f***ing head??" That dude was the MVP of the viewing.
2018-10-11 03:06:57 The movie is... not... good. It's not Fant4stic levels of bad or anything (though Kate Mara no longer has the "Worst Wig in a Superhero Movie" award), but it suffers from a lot of pacing and story problems. It feels like it's constantly sprinting and yet not going anywhere. At least it apologizes for its own existence near the end.

Eddie and Venom never really "bond." The closest they have is Eddie laying ground rules at the end of the movie, but that's it. I guess there's something where Venom says they're both losers, but nothing really to make it feel like they're friends. That's mostly because neither really has a lot of character to them. Venom is mostly a bunch of for the evulz remarks and that's about it. Brock has a sort of "stand up to the man" outlook on journalism that just kind of... stops and never really informs his actions after the first act.

Also, I'm confused about Riot. There's a major plot point about how hard it is for symbiotes to find hosts, but Riot just body surfs like nothing. Actually, that entire plot point about Venom killing Brock just drops off after a while with no conclusion. Also, Riot apparently has "weapons," but it's not really clear how it's different than Venom's combat tentacles and body manipulation. And why did Riot want Venom in the first place?

I get the feeling a lot of story beats got partially cut from this thing.

The first action scene with the symbiote has some clever staging, but the editing is terrible. It then bleeds into a chase scene that has some neat moments, but definitely feels like it goes on way too long.

The biggest sign of the less than clear plan the movie was made with is a scene where Eddie goes into a store around 2pm or something and comes out after sunset. How did that happen?

And the post credits sequel bait is just terrible.

Finally, I'm not a fan of the symbiote design. I know it's probably intended to make them look more like lifeforms, but I'd prefer a less busy, more solid design when they aren't using tentacles and whatnot. It would make them look less cheesy, and it would help make Carnage's design look that much more different from the standard symbiote.

Long story short, I didn't hate it, but it didn't really do much for me and I'm not particularly excited for what else Sony is cooking up.

Spiderverse looks pretty neat though.
2018-10-11 03:54:06 My Non-Spoilery Opinion:  
I'm still Amazed by the Movie, i admit i had the fear that it's was goin' to disappoint...  
But it was PERFECT, the Kid in me is Happy! The Adult is Pleased!  
For me it was a Solid 10/10  
Perfect retelling of Venom without Spidey first.  
For me it made it more interesting\~  
And i really Bonded (heh) with the Characters  
Got that goodie feelin' in mah Belly the whole movie\~  
Don't understand the Low Scores, but i do try to respect non-hating low reviews!  
It is My Favorite Movie of 2018 so far!

But like i said, respectin' opinions here!
2018-10-13 05:53:45 I thought it was really good. It definitely didn’t deserve the reviews it got. Venom and Tom Hardy were fantastic in this film. Sure some of the side characters and parts of the plot were weak, but let’s be honest most super hero movies are. I think if this movie was in the MCU and not made by Sony people would’ve seen it in a different light. I think people came into it with negative feelings towards it to begin with and it’s clouding their judgement 
2018-10-14 09:40:08 People over analyze movies way too much these days. This movie was enjoyable with realistic expectations, yet obviously not the best super hero movie we have seen in recent years. 29% is absurdly harsh and makes me think rotten tomatoes has lost its credibility lately. I hope to see a sequel 
2018-10-31 05:49:10 I love Venom. He's probably one of my top 5 favorite comic book characters. I really wanted to like this movie. I tried to like this movie. It was garbage, pure and simple. A disgrace to one of the most fascinating characters. What a waste. I liked Venom's voice and some of his lines, and the fight with the swat team and Riot were ok. Now that what little good the movie had is out of the way...

Venom should be a horror/sci-fi movie. It should be "Alien" on Earth. This black, horrifying, alien entity eating human brains in dark alleys, looking for a perfect host to bond with. Sony decided that they wanted to go the comedy route. With Venom. Well, if it works, it works. It doesn't. The humor is cringeworthy and forced. Seeing "Eddie Brock" look at Venom in the mirror for the first time and shriek like a 13 year old schoolgirl, fall back, hit his head and pass out in the tub was embarrassing to say the least. I put Tom Hardy's character in quotation marks because I don't know who he was playing, but it wasn't Eddie Brock. I love Tom Hardy, and one would think the man who played Bane would be perfect as Brock, which makes the script and direction all the more baffling. First, he talks like a sissy. His voice is pathetic. He sounds like an insecure wuss who talks facing the ground. On top of that, he's a total pussy. Making an effort to say hi to his ex-fiance's new boyfriend and having his arm left outstretched...pathetic. Enduring his neighbor's blaring music in one scene, and having it interrupt his meditation session in another...Meditating. Eddie Brock is meditating. I can't shake off the final scene where he's sitting like a schoolgirl with his hands between his closed legs on the stairs. In what kind of alternate universe does Eddie Brock sit like this? Act like this? Talk like this? I understand when changes are made to characters based on comic books, in order to bring them to life on the screen, but if you make a bizarre decision such as making Eddie Brock a wimp, you damn better make it work. It does not. He's pathetic. The restaurant scene where he begins eating random food and dunks himself in the lobster tank is, yet again, embarrassing. Cringeworthy. Baffling. 

Eddie Brock is a bully. He's an asshole. He's a lovable jerk. He likes to work out. He is attracted to power. He is ambitious. We see none of those traits in this character Tom Hardy plays in what is probably his worst acting role ever. In another baffling decision, his Catholic background is completely ignored in this movie. Eddie initially believes, rightly so, that the entity invading him is a demon. This gives way to easily exploitable themes of good and evil, power and temptation, corruption and damnation. Absolutely nothing of this sort is explored in the movie, aside from "Eddie" mentioning to his ex-fiance the attraction of the power the symbiote gave them, only as an afterthought in the literal last scene of the movie. Speaking of his fiance, this too has to be Michelle Williams' worst role ever. I love her too, and seeing her in a dial in role with an obvious wig on almost made me feel bad for her. The epitome of the lame and forced humor of the movie is in the scene where she kisses "Eddie" in the forest. This is a woman who after being taken over by an alien entity (female Venom looked pretty cool), tracks down and kisses her ex-fiance to transfer the entity, then sees him transform into a horrendous monster in front of her, and watches him run away. Her reaction to this unique experience? "Oh, that's such bullshit!". Unbelievable. The people involved with writing this garbage script were obviously influenced in all the wrong ways by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Another baffling decision? The music. The very first song that plays when "Eddie" gets on his motorcycle...Unbelievable. The tone they tried to set in this movie with the music is ridiculous and fails time and time again with each passing song. The original soundtrack isn't that great either. Speaking of cheap hires with cheap results in multiple departments, the CGI...Wow. It is fascinating to see that the special effects for Venom are not even as good as the ones in Spiderman 3. That movie is 11 years old. Eleven. If it has anything worth rescuing, it's how good Venom looks. Skinny, yes, but he looks cool. The only times the CGI here looked good was when the symbiote's head talks to "Eddie". Even then, the rest of his body (the tendrils) doesn't look that great. Overall, this is a cheap movie. I'm not even going to get into how the writers had no idea about what Venom is. Establishing the symbiote and Eddie as 2 halves, even having the symbiote call itself "Venom" (and a "loser", dear God...), instead of the 2 halves being Eddie Brock and Eddie Brock plus the symbiote (Venom). One of the most interesting characters to explore duality with, and instead we get lame jokes and the symbiote asking, for no logical reason at all other than to stick in another joke because "the MCU is successful so let's force humor everywhere in a movie about alien possession", for tater tots. Right. Hilarious.

I had a bad feeling about this movie right from the lame intro. Seriously, how is the introductory scene (which shows way too much), the one before you reveal the title of the movie, about a random woman walking off in the middle of a road in the middle of nowhere to get to a place we know nothing about? I brushed this off and tried to get into the movie, but it wasn't until the symbiote actually merged with someone that it got even remotely interesting or with a hint of a decent pace. The scene where "Eddie" finally turns into Venom is less than powerful, and by the time the symbiote invades a tiny dog, my hopes were out the window. The villain is forgettable, his main henchman is forgettable, the scientist is forgettable, the female lead is forgettable...The writing is poor and lazy, such as with how a little girl is possessed and walks into a high security lab with no one stopping her on her way.

Again, I liked the Venom voice, and some of his lines were cool (the "pussy" one was a highlight I must say), and his powers were perfectly depicted, but this cheap movie was yet another chance to tell the story of a fascinating character that has been flushed down the drain. I am disappointed that this movie went a different route than what the character and his story called for, but again, if their way had worked, then that would be that. The real disappointment is in this movie being cheap garbage flushed out for a quick buck, but without it even trying to tell a respectable story, instead opting to go the easy way with forced humor and a dumb light tone.

I still love you Venom, but I won't hold my breath for you to be done justice on the big screen anytime soon.

&#x200B;

P.S. To add insult to injury, I waited through 17 minutes of credits to see a shit animation that looked like a videogame cutscene from a 1998 game, that had nothing to do with neither Venom nor Spiderman. Pathetic.
2018-10-05 06:11:02 That was a weird movie. Like... I don't think I'd call it "bad" per say. It's bizarre enough to be decent. But if a story comes out that Hardy was drunk off his ass the entire shoot I'd buy it.

If nothing else, Venom fighting the SWAT team was a badass sequence that really showcased what I've always thought a Venom movie could be like.

And I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be down to see what Woody Harrelson would be like as Carnage. Especially with that cheesy as fuck sequel hook line.
2018-10-05 16:45:18 so its gonna be baywatch all over again where the critics trashed it but the audience score was high enough for the rock himself to basically say fuck the critics 
2018-10-06 07:42:09 I actually really enjoyed this movie. There was for sure some dumb shit and cringe dialogue but overall I found it fun and I really liked the interaction between Venom and Eddie. Not nearly as bad as people made it out to be. 
2018-10-06 18:22:34 I and everyone I went with enjoyed it. It’s a fun movie, kinda like the first Transformers movie. Not the best movie I ever watched, but a solid theater movie that even my wife and my friend’s fiancé liked. For what it is, I give it a 7/10. 
2018-10-06 22:16:29 Definitely entertaining but very much a cookie-cutter Sony movie. They played it safe and went for the money and the broader audience. It just lacks that Marvel magic. Very funny though!
2018-10-07 03:43:21 This movie was wildly entertaining. There were definitely some terrible aspects *cough cough Michelle Williams* but Tom Hardy was pretty great. Venom interactions were great and I wish there was more Venom overall. Movie would’ve been a lot better for it. Despite the shitty ratings, I’m really hoping the studio makes another because I think there’s a lot of potential now that they’ve fleshed out the characters. 
2018-10-08 01:40:23 I'm usually pretty crabby about my movies, but I had a good time. Potential spoilers throughout this post that I'm too lazy to tag, read at your own risk. 

Pros: 

* Venom looked good
* Humor was great, Hardy nailed it
* That fight with the soldiers was awesome
* Venom wingman dynamic is fun

Cons: 

* First act took a while, third act felt rushed
* Villain wasn't scary at all. Could have used better dialogue, imo. 

I'll reserve judgement about Harrelson, I've seen weird things work in comic book movies before. I hope this thing sticks around, really liked Hardy as Eddie Brock. Give Tom Holland some time to grow up into the role, though, because this Venom would eat his Spider-Man for breakfast. 

Also, a question; what happened to the fourth symbiote? 

* The first one got away on landing, and it was Riot. 
* One died in the lab, the one that Baddie McMeanface used to kill the whistle blower lady. 
* Venom got away. 

I thought there was a yellow one? What happened to the 4th one? 
2018-10-08 04:29:16 I thought it was pretty bad honestly... knowing the bare minimum about the movie I went in thinking it was going to be serious fare like Batman begins...and honestly the visual style kind of suggested it.

The humor was cringe worthy a lot of times, Venom just kept getting progressively more "Marvel humor-ish" through out the movie, it was weird.  Many things seemed either rushed or unexplained...like why all of sudden they've got this great bond?  It was never suggested prior to that scene.  

The villain was basically a nobody.  The CGI was also suspect in a few areas,

I'd say the biggest enjoyment of the movie for me was watching serious and gruff Tom Hardy playing a weak and humorous role.
2018-10-11 17:33:47 Michelle Williams is just awful in this. That's not to say that she's a bad actress, she's just left with a terrible script and a weird character. Nearly every person in this movie has awful dialogue but hers in delivered like she can't quite believe she's having to say it. 

Hard to believe this is the same person who delivered such an amazing performance in Manchester By The Sea. 
2018-10-05 10:45:21 To be fair this movie wasn't THAT bad. I was never expecting MCU level story, character and world building but I was entertained and that's what it's ultimately all about.

Seriously, Tom Hardy really did a great job with what he was given.

&nbsp;

why are these movies so hyped up if the fans are okay with mediocrity
2018-10-05 17:18:52 I thought the movie was OK. My daughter the 15-year-old marvel fan loved.

What really really really really really really really really really really bothered me throughout the whole film was that Tom Hardy looks so disheveled. And Michelle Williams looks so flawless. They look like two characters from two different movies.
2018-10-11 01:52:36 i really did not enjoy this movie. i can see people finding some weird enjoyment out of it, but it was objectively a bad movie. slow then too fast in pacing, tone was completely inconsistent, acting was flat and his ex gf was awful. felt no sympathy for any of the characters, venoms change of heart came out of nowhere. riot had no development and i cared so little for him. the final fight was short and uninteresting. SPOILER: when venom "died", then he just.. wasn't dead? this whole movie was a mess. such a shame, i really went in wanting to love it. ugh... this was just sad. i wanted a great venom movie... i don't really know what it is that we got with this. would love to discuss with people on here 
2018-10-05 06:16:03 Tom Hardy is, unsurprisingly, great as Eddie Brock.  Overall the movie was better than I'd hoped. Pacing is good, the characters were interesting and reasonably well developed.

 Not going to win any awards, but a solid 7/10.
2018-10-05 06:24:19 This was the most boring "super hero" movie I've seen since...I don't even know. Even Fan4stick (which was a worse movie) was at least engaging in how terrible it was.

This movie was just there.

And on those few occasions when it did pick up and get moving, it slipped into stupidity, with Venom spiting out one-liners and try hard comedy/snarky lines. Really bad.

There's something about seeing this character---that I always associate with a parasitic villain---instead be a wisecracking, lovable loser alien "sim-bi-oat" that says "thank you" and dispenses relationship advice that just rubbed me the wrong way. The whole premise of the movie started it on the wrong foot.

Michelle Willaims' acting was also really bad and Riz Ahmed was a comic book movie villain straight out of the mid-90's. In fact this whole movie felt like it came from an alternate universe where comic book movies never really evolved out of the mid-90's era.

Woody Harrelson as Carrot Top brought the biggest reaction from the theater I attended, and it was unintentional comedy.

One of the complaints I knew about before the movie's release was that there wasn't enough "Venom" but it seemed to me like the movie was exposed with as much of the character as they had. This is not a character that can carry a franchise. He has no "rogue's gallery" (Carnage is it in terms of rivals) because he, himself, is a rogue. Watching him jump around looking like a the swamp thing was dunked in oil and splatterd with jizz just didn't work. Flawed as it was (too skinny), the character actually looked better in Spider-Man 3. At least it had a proper logo on its chest.

The more I saw this Venom fighting folks, either ordinary people with guns or giant copycat-symbiote monsters, the more hollow the experience felt.

Venom's story only works as an extension of Spider-Man's. It's an alien symbiote that took advantage of Peter Parker and became an inner foil for him until he finally shed it in a moment of triumph...only for the parasite to latch on to an even more dangerous host and become a proper villain. That's a great story. It's also a great SPIDER-MAN story. It's not Venom's story and this movie's attempt to remove Spider-Man from the equation and create a new backstory for "Eddie Brock" just failed to connect with me.

I know Sony will want to press forward and make a Carnage movie, but I really hope this is a one and done. There wasn't anything worth continuing here, imo.
2018-10-05 16:40:10 Love that so many accounts that have been silent for months or even years woke up just to say nice things about Sony's movie!

Must be just THAT good 
2018-10-06 21:00:30 Fuck it. It was a super fun movie. I want a sequel.



2018-10-05 17:24:09 I went in with very low expectations. But was pleasantly surprised. The humour was great Tom hardy was really great. The chemistry between venom and Eddie made the movie, but I still felt that the bonding of that relationship was rushed. Maybe it was covered in the 40mins that Tom said was cut from the film? Would love to see the extended version on bluray sometime. 
It script and directing could use some work but Overall, a solid and fun movie. 
2018-10-05 22:30:52 /r/hailcorporate, nice try, Sony.
2018-10-06 18:23:32 If there is one decent aspect to “Venom” it is Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom. I do love the chemistry between Eddie and Venom (if that makes any sense). He has great banter with himself and the quippy symbiote that lives in his head. Oh yeah, that’s something that was never established in any of the trailers. “Venom” is not a threat, but instead a fucking comedian. Hardy does deliver a good performance that could’ve been redeemed if the material he was working with was stronger than the cringefest of the script he was given, and his American accent is improving. His accent here is thoroughly consistent and his comedic timing keeps the film entertaining.

While the PG-13 rating is tame, they were set to have this Venom go face to face with Spider-Man one day. In order to do that, they have to emulate the same tone as a MCU movie. When Venom is in Eddie’s body it becomes a two-man act routine like Jim Carrey in “Liar Liar” or “The Mask”. Eddie is the dummy and Venom is a ventriloquist with the power to make you indestructible and have cannibalistic tendencies. You’re going to laugh a lot during this, whether it is intentional or not, because the film is riddled with so many plot holes and bad dialogue. So, when the movie tries to get serious, you can never take it seriously because of how awful the script is and how poorly-written the characters are.

Tom Hardy is trying, but fuck his dialogue is bad. The entire narrative of the film is a damn joke and, while it’s entertaining, “Venom” lacks substance and memorability for you to give a shit about the Sony/Marvel non-Spider-Man universe. What could’ve been a great story is now a fucking joke. You turned one of Spider-Man’s biggest foes into a damn joke. While I am laughing, it is most certainly AT them, not with them. Scenes that are supposed to be humorous often flop, and when characters do stupid things (which is often) this turns into one of the best unintentional comedies of the year.

At the end of the day, THIS DOES NOT NEED TO EXIST. You took a page out of Marvel’s book of tricks with the tone and incorporated the dumbest methods possible out of desperation. You were fucking seperate to make a Spider-Man universe and hoped to god to see them crossover so you pussied out and made a PG-13 comedy out of it.

2018-10-06 19:13:09 Well now... jesus.

Inconsistent tone, a seemingly rushed and cliche ridden script and at times poor acting, lower budget than probably needed.... this movie could have been great, it could have been in the MCU.... but it's not, trying it's own elseworlds thing. It's not Fallen Kingdom bad, but still. Yeesh. Venom, which is apparently his name from the get go just suddenly wants to help Eddie and save humanity because he likes him after only a short amount of time... oh and because Venom doesn't want any other of his kind on earth because he's not that great compared to most others of his kind. Okay. Movie needed to be R and have a lot more gore. Srsly, Riot hits people with his axe hands and they're just pushed away instead of being sliced to pieces. The action was at least pretty decent, the Venom vs Riot fight was good, the She-Venom cameo was nice, and the theme for the movie by Eminem was dope as fuck. Oh, and in another departure from the comics, Cassidy ALREADY has the Carnage symbiote, and it's resting itself on his head as a really bad wig. But that "there's gonna be ***carnage***" line from Cassidy was so... ugh. And what about the other symbiotes at the bad guys lab? They dead or what? Venom should have fought them, not just Riot at the end.
2018-10-08 00:12:37 Just saw it. Went in with low expectations and left happy. Obvious negatives are pacing issue, car chase and kinda weak boss fight. Other than that it's fine. I'd give it solid 7, 5/10
2018-10-05 06:06:00 Meh, it's fine. Hardy is great, Ahmed good as always. Funny and fun for mostly intentional reasons, but takes a fuck of a long time to get going. I'd see a sequel, especially with Harrelson as Carnage. 6/10
2018-10-05 06:22:56 Boy, I can't wait for the sequel when the antagonist venom fights is another symbiote again.  That won't be repetitive in the slightest!
2018-10-05 06:35:02 [deleted]
2018-10-05 11:50:09 It was definitely more fun than sonys attempts at the amazing spiderman. All the back and forth with hardy and venom were great, decent action, but the other characters weren’t anything special. Def not as bad as 30% imo
2018-10-05 13:19:42 This movie isn’t horrible, it isn’t even bad. I actually really enjoyed it and would put it at the same level of Antman and the Wasp! Really fun, funny (sometimes accidentally?), and sometimes just straight up weird. I’ll take it. Go see it if you’re interested!
2018-10-05 22:09:52 Honestly, I wasn't expecting much because I had seen the rating on Rotten Tomatoes... but guess what, I really liked *Venom*. The first act was the only part that I disliked, but things really picked up after the time jump to six months later. My favourite part is definitely the symbiotic bond of Eddie and Venom. It's crazy and weird how Venom who is voiced by Tom Hardy feels like an entirely different character on its own, even though it doesn't actually exists (meaning that it's all CGI aka fake).

2018-10-05 23:09:39 Good to see any and all positive comments are being downvoted. Still gonna pay to see it.  
2018-10-06 02:46:04 Loved the movie, only parts I didn’t like was Woody Harrelson as Cletus and the fact that the symbiotes named each other Riot and Venom. It was kind of cringy like what they do in Transformers. They’re aliens, why are they naming each other Riot and Barricade.
2018-10-06 09:25:45 Weird disconnect here with the reviewers. It wasn't perfect, but it was far from horrible. I went in expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised.

I hope the Carnage movie happens.
2018-10-07 00:54:19 It was pretty good, if they made a Venom 2 I'll pay to see it. I don't see all the hate behind it, people are just ignorant with all the hate towards it
2018-10-07 08:13:09 You know what, here we go.

I loved Venom!

Was it perfect? No, but there was genuinely a lot of great material. The action for the most part was incredible, and there was a lot more humor than I expected! I thought Tom Hardy was incredible - he completely sold me on Eddie Brock’s character. I also really enjoyed the dynamic between Eddie and Venom.

That said, some flaws: the story felt very rushed and a little choppy at times, particularly getting to the final fight. Some scenes also dragged here and there. I didn’t hate Riz Ahmed as the villain but I did find him very generic and not too interesting. The overall story was a little bit unoriginal as well.

Nevertheless, I thought the positives hugely outweighed the negatives. The critics really got it wrong on this one; it’s not a masterpiece but I think it deserves more praise than it’s getting. I think the audiences will have a great time, and I certainly did. 7.5/10!
2018-10-05 06:14:14 Honestly, I feel like in another universe there is an R rated version of this movie that cuts out the entire first 45 minutes and is a great film.
2018-10-05 06:39:34 Eh, thought the movie was average 
2018-10-05 09:42:49 I wish we had a scene like this since Venom has an immature personality.

Venom- "Who is that?"(News report showing Spider-Man swinging)

Eddie- "Spider-Man"

Venom-"I like him"(Now we have the spider chest and maybe a web swing or two)
2018-10-05 09:57:48 I think it’s terrible but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a fun time with it
2018-10-05 10:09:46 It was just full of action and pretty much zero story and character development.

Venom kind of just went from I'm going to murder everyone to, well, I guess I better save the planet in literally one scene with no real reason to change. It's like if a TV shows kills off someone then brings them back, they're like, well he wasn't really dead, so let's move on and leave off where we were. Like what the fuck is that shit.

I really didn't give a shit about Brock's relationship. They didn't make me care at all if he lost his fiance. They didn't make me care about him trying to get her back. The weird kiss in the woods that resulted in no story later, just a "you kissed me" and her character going okay, and leaving.

There are plenty of more examples of no development and story.

This movie is missing like everything besides the action.

But the Venom character is so badass, I wish this could have been something.
2018-10-05 13:11:35 I'm curious, I've been following some of the clips released on YouTube, and the editing in all of them was borderline incoherent. Does it stay that way through the film?
2018-10-05 18:31:45 So to me it sounds average. Not unwatchable not a future classic but good. Nothing really wrong with that. 

I think its the kind of movie where people can say: It couldve done this or that better but for what it did it was decent. Maybe a sequel will improve on those flaws
2018-10-05 22:04:12 I’m not really sure where this franchise goes without Spider-Man. You can’t really have an arc for Venom/Eddie unless you straight up make him a hero. 

A proper arc would have Eddie embracing the worst parts of Venom (kind of hinted at by saying they will eat “bad” people only) and then having Spider-Man enter the picture. 
2018-10-06 00:16:45 In the mid credits scene, Cletus wrote "Welcome Eddie" with his own blood, which means he has a fresh wound somewhere. 

In the comics, Carnage is born when Venom leaves a piece of him behind, who proceeds to merge with Cletus's blood. 

I'm thinking that a possible sequel will start right where this one left off. 


2018-10-06 02:35:02 I kind of liked it. It was fun, had some third act problems(like 90% of comic book movies do), the motives for some of the characters was pretty muddied and sometimes nonsensical, but it was overall enjoyable. 
2018-10-06 02:39:27 The thing about is this movie is that it’s gotten me really excited for the SEQUEL (provided it does well enough to warrant one). 

The movie actually works pretty damn well. Eddie/Venom relationship is absolutely perfect, and the fully formed Venom character is handled quite competently. Some people are saying the actors messed up a bunch of stuff but all the actors are really quite good, it’s just that their characters are written in poorly. They’re doing the best with what they have to do and for the most part it lands. 


The big thing that bogs the movie down is the pacing, as well as the script at many points. This is the first entry in a planned series, and seeing how Venom is more complex than most heroes, it makes sense that the plot is too wild of a rollercoaster, especially to people who are not familiar with the character. The pacing of the movie definitely warrants a few complaints, it does feel like this movie was shat out a bit too soon. HOWEVER: 

Most of the complaints this movie is getting are things that can be fixed in the next movie with more competent direction. All the moving parts and pieces seem to line up perfectly- the actors are solid, the plots that Venom could follow are interesting, and I was quite a big fan of the sound design. I feel like in the SEQUEL, give the characters a little bit more to do, and spend less time establishing stuff quickly and there’s honestly a chance of something really special here. 
2018-10-06 08:23:59 Venom was dope. 
2018-10-06 09:53:14 The only positives for me were Tom Hardy, the dynamic between Eddie and Venom, and 90% of the action scenes. The movie is hot garbage otherwise but I can’t lie that I didn’t have fun when Venom was kicking ass. 

The worst part of the movie was the pacing. Everything moved so freaking fast that I never had time to get invested in anything. I never gave a shit about Eddie and Anne’s relationship or Carlton Drake’s motivations. The story and characters were paper thin as a result of the movie moving at Mach speed even though the running time is almost 2 hours.

Some of the dialogue and acting was pretty awful. Riz Ahmed looked like he was bored the entire time and the bald henchman that chases Eddie (Treece) was unbearable for the little amount of screen-time he had. On a related note, the line from one of the trailers “That guy you work for is an evil person!” actually got removed so at least there’s that. However, “There will be *carnage*” is the worst thing I’ve seen in a long time.

The final fight was polarizing because most of the time, it was dark as hell and the visuals looked messy so I couldn’t stop saying “What the hell is going on??” Also, thanks to the lightning-speed pacing, the fight just feels like it ends like nothing and absolutely no payoff was felt to be had.

On a final note, the movie seriously would have benefited with an R-rating. The movie is going to be mediocre no matter the rating but it would’ve been much more satisfying to see Venom actually biting people’s heads off.
2018-10-06 18:08:53 Unfortunate that so many scenes of hardy were cut because he was really the only good aspect. A second venom could have potential. Sony just need to hire a good writer and competent director to put around hardy. Not holding my breath that thatll happen though.  
2018-10-06 23:20:05 They changed the wrong pronounciation of Symbiote from the trailers. Only thing that stuck with me after leaving the theater.
2018-10-07 00:28:24 I enjoyed the movie. The only issue is I kept thinking it was a gritty reboot of the Mask
2018-10-07 06:51:06 Is no one gonna talk about how coincidentally Annie can also assimilate with the symbiote while life has a hard time with literally everyone else. Id say its some ex machina shit for eddie to get venom back
2018-10-07 07:17:51 Along with the little girl never getting to ask her question, one funny scene I found was when Eddie was logging into Michelle Williams' laptop, looking over his shoulder a few times to make sure she doesn't catch him snooping through her files, instead of just sitting on the other side of the table so the screen doesn't face the hallway.

2018-10-07 11:55:19 The movie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be honestly.The dialogues were stupid at times,the CGI wasn't good(especially with venom's face I think)and I couldn't care less about Anne but all things considered it was pretty entertaining and I don't regret spending my time and money watching it.
2018-10-07 15:40:06 It was entertaining...I went in with some pretty low expectations but Tom Hardy was good especially voicing Venom as well. Worth a watch in the cinema 
2018-10-08 06:51:42 I thought it was fun. The venom lines were cringy like people say, but they were a so bad it's good cringy for me, which I think is what they were going for since Venom said he was a loser on his home planet. I hope when this comes out on DVD they include the 40 mins of cut footage Hardy mentioned 
2018-10-08 07:44:03 It was a lot better than I expected especially with all the hate it was getting a couple days ago. I walked in thinking I was going to see some decent action scenes, which I got, but what I didn’t expect was the friendly humor between Brock and Venom.

I’ll probably watch it again soon. 
2018-10-08 19:35:03 Watched this today, somehow don't feel like a Marvel movie to me. Although, enjoyable throughout. My issue is the motivation for Venom to become the good guy was pretty stupid. There was also no real relationship development between Eddie and Venom, they just sort of becomes best buddies all of a sudden. And I heard Eddie was supposed to be a loser, yet it doesn't really feel that way.


2018-10-09 11:05:04 That Girl Venom is gonna give a lot of kids weird boners. All jokes aside the movie was okay. Venom was fun but everything else was pretty unmemorable and boring. I definitely need more action. Overall I give it 6.5, Tom Hardy had fun.
2018-10-09 20:07:26 Is Tom Hardy a big guy in this movie?
2018-10-12 01:53:33 After expecting a car reck I actually enjoyed this film. It isn't amazing but it is sort.of decent
2018-11-03 14:04:18 Saw this movie today. I'm impressed.
2018-11-25 07:37:33 Actually enjoyed the film, but because of Venom/Brock interactions. It worked really well. Of course the rest of the movie was straight up rushed and just felt shallow.

If only they got the Marvel treatment - Tom hardy and Venom could go really far I think. 
2018-10-05 06:19:58 They actually did a fantastic job with Eddie and the symbiotes dynamic. I want more scenes of just the two of them bickering with each other, they were all great.
2018-10-05 08:08:39 I ended up liking the film enough that I would watch it again.   I think Hardy really holds up the movie, he turns in such an out-there and bizarre performance that his character becomes quite compelling after the inciting incident. The play between Brock and Venom was fun to watch and easily the best part of the movie (though, as others have said I couldn't help but think of Upgrade a few times).  I actually thought most of the action was pretty well done until the climax, which ended up being quite a mess visually.  The story isn't much in the way of intelligent, but I got past it.

That said, if I try to frame my feelings about the film using based on the character's potential and his history in the comic books, I'm a little disappointed that we get this "re-imagined for standalone franchise" version.  For me, the character is really missing something without the Spider-Man connection and more of an evil/chaotic tone.  It's just weird to see Venom out of his original context.  It feels so removed that it's Venom in name and concept only.
2018-10-05 08:37:49 I actually had a really good time watching this and enjoyed it for what it was. It did feel like it took too long for Venom to actually show up in the movie though. Also thought it was weird for them to pull a reverse Pixar and put an animated short at the end of the credits.
2018-10-05 08:47:44 Loved the movie. The only parts I didn't like was the kiss scene between Eddie and Venom-Annie and the fight scene near the rocket.

I feel like that kiss scene would have been sweeter and cute if she had been single. Her being in a stable relationship (she gave Dan her apartment key, that's a huge step) made the scene feel stale.

And that fight scene. Oh my god. It was a mess. The two aliens blended too well into the dark grey background. It was sometimes hard to see where they were, who was who, and what happened. The fight was way too fast to almost keep up.

I also could've sworn Venom had something to do with Spider-man, so really curious how different the whole thing was without Spiderman.

7/10. The plot wasn't that good compared to other Marvel movies, the only thing that kept me interested was the awesome and funny interaction between Eddie and Venom.
2018-10-05 09:03:59 It is nowhere close to *Catwoman* bad although I completely understand the comparison to the movie ("TURN DOWN THE MUSIC!" screams our whacked out protagonist after munching on disgusting food). It very much does feel like an early 2000's movie.  
  
Tom Hardy looks like he had a blast playing a complete spaz in this movie. It was nice seeing him not take himself so seriously for once. Riz Ahmed actually plays a pretty humorously over the top  if not lukewarm villain that thinks he is God.  
  
The CGI is terrible and this movie brings nothing new that you haven't seen done (better) in a bunch of other Comic Book properties like Ant-Man or Luke Cage already.
  
It isn't good. It isn't so bad it's good. It's entertainingly cheesy and that's about the best I can say.  
  
**Edit: I will also say though that I don't think the lack of Spider-Man is what is wrong with this movie. It almost has something of it's own and could have, I think. However it falls short.**
2018-10-05 09:48:35 Sitting in the theater atm and I gotta say though it wasn’t a great movie and it has its flaws but god damn I throughly enjoyed myself while watching it. 
2018-10-05 10:36:01 Why was the Life Foundation using incendiary exploding drones when they most likely knew, after studying the symbiotes for six months, that fire was one of their weaknesses? Had they been successful, they would have destroyed the symbiote which they wanted to only capture and bring back.

Also, I would have much preferred if the post-credits scene was Brock at his network's HQ given an assignment from his boss, with an exchange going something like this:

\>BOSS: Just received a call from San Quentin. It appears that your story on Drake has caught the attention of one of their inmates. He wants to talk to you.

\>BROCK: Don't you think that's a bit below my pay grade?

\>BOSS: Well, he's no ordinary convict. You were still in New York when he was on the loose, but he left behind quite the trail of bodies and had a highly-publicized trial. He's the most notorious serial killer we've had since the Zodiac. We, were among dozens of publications that wanted to get an interview with him, but he's remained silent up until now. Now, he's ready to talk, and he's asking specifically for you.

\>BROCK: What's his name?

\>BOSS: Cletus Kasady.

End scene. Would've preferred it over the cheesy, on-the-nose name drop of Carnage at the end.
2018-10-05 12:23:03 My only familiarity with Venom is from the previous Spider Man films, so idk how closely this aligned with his comic origins, but I enjoyed it. 

Some dialogue is clunky, it’s a bit formulaic and some CGI is woeful (that spaceship in the first scene, holy moly) but I had a good time watching it. The banter between Eddie & Venom was unexpectedly fun and Tom Hardy gives a good performance, even if I don’t completely buy his investigative reporter persona. Lots of laughs in my theater overall. 

Better than The Predator, that’s for sure. 
2018-10-05 14:46:25 I think some of the critics or even viewers are a bit harsh on the movie. It's bad, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. A lot of it probably has to do with the fact that it's Venom.   
  
That said, far from a good movie. The only highlight in the film is Tom Hardy's Eddie, Venom and their relationship. Hardy's acting coupled with the character dynamic is the only thing that is carrying the entire film.   
   
The plot is simple, very similar to the early marvel films; generic cbm plot. The characters, apart from Eddie, are largely forgettable, even the villian. There was hardly any proper characterisation for any of them. Not even Anne, not even Venom. Venom started off as this Deadpool-ish character, so there was hardly any depth to him at the start. But once the film reaches the climax, they throw a huge 180 for the character that is only barely justified. Also, very very incompetent, dumb villians/scientists.  
  
Pacing wise, starts slow and suddenly catapults you into the climax. It's quite a 'wtf' moment when you reach the climax, because it's so sudden. The climax itself also just ends in a 10min fight scene that has no tension at all. The tone of the movie is also all over the place. It's a bit similar to Suicide Squad's issue, where the tone of the movie changes so suddenly that it's so bloody jarring.   
   
Maybe I'm spoilt, but I thought the CGI in certain scenes looked bad. I suppose the symbiotes are really difficult to animate as well.   
  
All in all, not an entirely terrible film. The Eddie-Venom dynamic was entertaining enough to carry the movie through it's first parts. Just based on that alone, a 4/10, or a 5/10 if more generous. Everything else fails; rehashed plot, linear characters, bad pacing, inconsistent tone, and the score wasn't even that good. Honestly, the movie would have been better if it had been a Prototype movie rather than a Venom movie; sleeper hit maybe. But with an asset as huge as Venom, the fact that they screw it up is just annoying.   
   
PS. She-Venom is hot.
2018-10-05 17:30:22 So, why did the symbiotes resemble Spider-Man? That never got explained. 
2018-10-05 20:08:50 7/10

I loved TASM more and I am so disappointed Marvel brought Disney, cause I really loved those movies and the attempted universe would've been great.

Venom is just alright.

It's too PG in tone I guess as there are some cheesy moments that scream studio interference  that wanted the movie to have cheesy thigns to attract more audience.

I enjoyed the movie and I really want a sequel that will be Rated R and made as a fan service rather than a movie that's supposed to attract everyone.
I believe fan service movie can be great for casual viewers as well.

Both after credits scenes are fucking amazing.
2018-10-06 00:07:01 Saw it last night. I felt like there was a whole part of the movie missing. The fight scene between the two symbiotes was a big mess and I was consciously thinking throughout the movie how it abandoned the incompatible host rule as they started switching with people so much.

Still enjoyed the parts with Tom Hardy who was the saving grace. Their dialogues (Tom and Venom) and action sequences were fun. Wish it had more of that. For this single reason I felt like I got my time's worth of movie. Everything else was crap. 
2018-10-07 03:47:33 well i liked it better than deadpool2
2018-10-07 05:18:58 Saw it and it cracked me up 😂😂😂 !!! The dialogue was so bad and they didnt waste anytime getting to the point nor did characters care about a lot of stuff. But that lobster scene tho HILARIOUS! I DIED haha! It's kinda like how the Room was really bad which made it funny (but not THAT bad), more along the lines of goofy action comedy like in Deadpool except not as violent. I personally enjoyed it and would RECCOMEND it for the laughs and goofs.
2018-10-07 16:45:57 Just finished the movie.

No expectations. My comic background is also very limited. The lines was a tad predictable. (saw the reuse of the not fond of heights thing a mile away) The "transition phase" of Venom was abrupt but it didn't ruin it for me. The highlights were his struggles with Venom and the way he peers into his thoughts. (Now that I think about it, it might be more significant)

Also the car featured - Nissan Rogue (Xtrail in my country) is the same as ours. Neat coincidence.

Overall fun movie.
2018-10-08 01:38:51 I put a “review” on my Instagram where I said it isn’t Daredevil bad, but it’s not good, and one of my friends messaged me saying I was the only person he knows say they didn’t like it. 

And I got that sense in the theatre that it was enjoyed. Sure, tons of kids and parents but still. I wonder if I came down too harsh on it? Some of the criticisms I’ve seen on it ring true, feels like 2004, final fight scene is hard to make out, and it’s just very lax on a lot of the logic without making up for it in spectacle like a Nolan movie would do. 

I didn’t like it, but when Eddie recognized Venom as not just a voice in his head, jt picked up. Their relationship was the best part of the film but everything else was eh. The first act of the film is sooo boring, it should have picked up from the scene in the bar and ease into exposition dumping, maybe having the escaped symbiote body hopping before it. 

I’m curious to see if this gets a sequel and if the studio, Avi Arad backs off a bit and let’s the creators have more free reign versus hitting all the Superhero beats. 

Also the kamikaze drones were pretty dumb lol 
2018-10-08 06:24:40 I cracked up so hard in the restaurant scene when he took that first bite of the hamburger or whatever and spit it out. The rest of that scene was hilarious too. 

I liked this movie. I can see why some might not like it but fuck it. 
2018-10-17 19:27:06 It was a cool movie, but bad movie. It was worth the $6 ticket but I'll never watch it again 
2018-10-18 05:32:51 I really liked this movie loved the dynamic of eddie and the parasite, don't really care to much about regular eddie though
2018-10-05 14:21:35 Christ almighty. Where do we begin?

The good: 
•Fixed a lot of the clunky dialogue in the trailers. Dialogue was still meh, but the delivery was a lot better. 
•CGI was on point.
•Not really to the credit of “Venom,” but I LOVED the preview of “Into the Spider-Verse” at the end. Super excited for that. 
Yeah, that’s about it.

The bad:
•Jesus Christ, the PACING in this movie is so bad. I couldn’t believe it. Everyone is talking about the first act being bad, but for me that third act was awful. I honestly felt like in production they were like “oh shit, guys. We gotta wrap this up.” Because it was like a light switch when Venom basically says “I’m a good guy now. Oh and by the way Drake is going to space because my buddy Riot bonded with him in a super quick scene on screen and I don’t like Riot because he’s more popular than me. We should do something about it tho. Remember when I said we hate fire? Let’s set him on fire.”
•I haaaaaaaaated how quirky they tried to make Venom. “HUNGRY!” “WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY?” “HE’S GOT SHIT YOU’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE!” 
•Woody Harrelson just wasn’t working for me as Carnage. 

I’m sure there’s more, but I went to the latest showing at my theater and I’m incredibly tired and having trouble remembering. 

Ultimately, it’s time to pack it up, Sony. Please work out a deal with Disney/Marvel Studios. Please don’t shoehorn Tom Holland into your shit universe when your deal with Disney/Marvel Studios is up. I’m sure they’re willing to play ball and give you guys a sweet deal. You’d basically be printing money. And if you can’t do that then maybe at the very least it’s time to demote Amy Pascal/Avi Arad. Goodnight. 
2018-10-05 06:23:40 This is the movie that's been getting nothing but rabid hate for the past week? *THIS?* It was fine. A solid 6.

Don't get me wrong, the movie is dumb. But it definitely isn't stupid. Not *THAT* stupid.

The only things I would knock the movie for are the bland score, the extremely weak writing, Michelle Williams, and the final action scene being a bit too hard to follow. 

Eddie and Venom's banter really worked, and Tom Hardy was obviously having a ton of fun in the role. Riz Ahmed was...fine. Everything was just fine. It's a Marvel movie with bad writing.

Everything that everybody was complaining about, like no Spider-Man, and no R-Rating are such non-arguments when put into context with the actual movie that I just watched. Spider-Man does not fit into the story, and an R-Rating would not have garnered any extra points for anyone. A bit of added blood splatter and a few extra "fucks" and "bitches" does not make this movie into a masterpiece of film, no matter how much you love Deadpool. The R Rating Circlejerk has got to end eventually.

Also, the "Venom Make-Out Scene" that everybody is pretending is the death of cinema makes complete and utter sense in the context it's portrayed within the movie. Don't listen to anybody who uses this scene as a criticism. 

It's....fine. It's just fine.

Verdict - If you like Venom, you will like the movie. (Multiple Easter Eggs, and Eddie and Venom are extremely accurately portrayed) If you like big dumb action movies, you will like the movie. If you go into the Sony Picture's produced VENOM film expecting high art, you will be disappointed, and honestly you kind of deserve it.
2018-10-07 09:48:40 It’s actually good. The critics have been way too harsh on this, see it yourself and don’t let yourself be influenced by Rotten Tomatoes.

2018-10-05 06:10:36 Jameson was one of the astronauts! Love it.
2018-10-05 08:44:44 It was fine. The characters weren’t really developed or explored which made it hard to really care about anyone. But the action was good and the banter between Eddie and Venom was pretty fun (minus the “pussy” line). I wasn’t really expecting too much, but I had a good time. 
2018-10-05 09:21:32 It was meh. It could have been better if they didn’t make Venom have a quip every 10 seconds like Spider-Man. The only funny thing Venom did was the ‘pussy’ scene. On the other hand, the post credit scene was amazing
2018-10-05 10:19:29 So what was the after credit scene?
2018-10-05 11:55:20 I enjoyed the heavy San Francisco presence, more SF scenes than Antman for sure. 

Anyone know the name of the dive bar near the beginning with the pool table? 
2018-10-05 15:04:28 What's in the post-credits scene ? The one at the very end of the credits roll ? I didnt stay till the very end, the missus rushed me out.
2018-10-05 19:02:14 When Venom got stabbed by Riot's blade, and he pulled it out near the end, there was this white exit wound. To me, it looked like a white spider for a split second, and I like to interpret it as a easter egg.
2018-10-06 00:59:05 Just tell me it was better than The Predator please...
2018-10-06 02:48:28 [deleted]
2018-10-06 10:01:30 Saw it twice (not intentionally) and I thought it was fun - obviously rushed, and it's clear that this was cut down to PG-13 (Riot slicing an entire room of people in half without a drop of blood tells me they probably just turned off the blood layer before finishing the rendering) but still fun.

The second time I saw it I was with my parents and they seemed to enjoy it more than the last few superhero movies I've seen with them, which seemed consistent with the audience in both screenings. I'd watch a sequel.
2018-10-06 11:35:40 My question is, weren’t there more symbiotes? I could’ve swore there were like 2 more they recovered? 
And What happened to that girl scientist assistant? 
2018-10-06 12:06:23 I just remembered something I was wondering when I saw it last night. 

How did the sounds of the rocket launching not bother either symbiote before Annie turned the volume to 11? I’m hoping there’s a science based answer about frequencies but that’s not my area of expertise. I remember thinking though “wait, this shit would be loud, wouldn’t it be disrupting them to some degree?”  
2018-10-07 03:24:49 Just got out of the theater and I loved it! There were some rushed moments which affects the beginnings pace but once Venom and Eddie are together it was fun and the story was awesome! Definitely recommend seeing it for yourself.
2018-10-07 03:31:02  Well it was definitely an entertaining movie, if nothing else. 
2018-10-07 05:15:56 Venom and Rampage right next to each other in the all time poll rankings, pretty fitting since I got a lot of rampage vibes here, especially from the life foundation and just kinda how they acted
2018-10-07 06:16:07 Is Eddie Brock a dick in its venom comics like he was portrayed in the Spider-Man movies?


2018-10-08 19:23:24 Question: are we to assume the symbiote (side note: did they redub saying “symbiote” after the backlash of the trailer?) that killed Skirth and disappeared is going to be Carnage that will infect Woody Harrelson somehow?
2018-10-10 01:38:15 Anyone got a link to the second post credit scene?
2018-10-10 08:43:41 Does anyone know the name of the self-help cd eddie brock puts in and listens to on the floor?
2018-10-16 03:03:51 My favorite aspect of the Carnage scene was the Dada reference, because I can just imagine the writer's room. Someone thinks that line up and is fighting tooth and nail for it to stay in even though everyone else is saying that most of their audience won't understand it.
2018-10-05 15:02:33 I mean it is a fair criticism but every time Reddit critics don't like a movie they always talk about pacing. I'm sure it's becoming a meme at this point.
P A C I N G
2018-10-07 23:14:50 Not good. 


Entertaining. 



Had potential 



Forced



Dialogue between venom and riot made me want to walk out of the theater. 




I liked Venoms voice and how it would pop up unexpectedly 




The best way I can put this movie into one description, it’s “Hot Topic”

2018-10-05 09:53:15 I was really satisfied with the movie, it suffers from being an Origin Story but all in all was pretty good. Tom Hardy nailed Eddie, Venom was a fun character, the film is littered with easter eggs, and the CGI really captured what Venom should look like. I'm really excited for the Blu-ray release now to see the 40mins that wasn't in the theatrical release, especially if Tom Hardy said they were his favorite scenes.

I recommend ignoring critics and going to see the movie for yourself.
2018-10-05 15:26:54 How is it that the best & most faithful thing about the movie is the Eminem song?
2018-10-05 17:38:14 Honestly, I liked it. Critics are way too harsh. Wasn't expecting or wanting Citizen Kane, but it was a lot of fun.
2018-10-06 07:06:01 It wasn't as bad as the reviews suggested, felt the critics came across as snarky assholes if anything. It's better than some of the worst MCU films (Thor: The Dark World comes to mind) as well as some of Sony's previous efforts (Think Amazing Spiderman 2, which I turned off after 20 minutes).

The best comparison would be to Sam Rami's Spiderman 1, the comparison of it being a superhero film from around 15 years ago is valid, they should have set it in 2004 and claimed it was a meta joke.
2018-10-07 04:41:39 Honestly it's not very good and the pacing is awful and the final battle is bordering on incomprehensible BUT it's worth seeing for Tom Hardy's fascinatingly bizarre performance alone, which I legitimately loved.
2018-10-07 18:08:29 I liked it. It wasn't great, but for me it feels like a Suicide Squad situation. The movie isn't all that good overall, but the bad things will be easily fixed in the sequel and the good thing, the acting and characterisation, is what's important in getting me interested in following the next story.
2018-10-08 11:42:50 it's a pretty awful movie, the main reason the general audience seems to be enjoying it is the fact that venom itself is cool as a concept and it's the first time we really get it and that tom hardy owns every role he's own no matter how bad the movie so you still can enjoy the movie somehow.
2018-10-08 14:40:58 Just saw it for a second time today, to see if me liking it the first time was a fluke or not. I actually liked it more the second time around, which is really weird considering I was looking for things that I didn't like about the movie. Maybe I knew what kind of humour and tone the movie was going for the second time around and that made me adjust my expectations when watching it.

I hated the first act when I saw it the first time, but I actually liked it more the second time viewing it. The first act has many subtle hints that pay off near the end of the movie. First viewing was a 7/10, now it's about an 8/10.
2018-10-05 08:14:34 Lol. 😂😂😂

> [#VENOM is the THE ROOM of superhero films. Both films take place in San Francisco, both are loaded with painful cringe-worthy dialogue that feels like placeholder for the real thing, and both have an insane, manic central performance that kind of make them worth checking out.](https://twitter.com/davechensky/status/1048056424574664705?s=09) 
2018-10-05 10:31:52 I would watch venom again before I ever watch Thor, thor 2, iron man 2, and a few others. 


Those other movies follow a basic ass formula. 


Venom was entertaining. A lot of flaws but it was a good time. 
2018-10-07 20:50:02 The critics mayn’t have liked it but me and my friends did
2018-10-11 23:50:07 I guarantee that if this movie said it was made by Marvel Studios and not in association with, critics would drool over it and give it a minimum of a 70.
2018-10-05 06:10:23 Honestly way better than I expected. 

Now, that's partly to do with my expectations being "ever so slightly better than Fant4stic", so it wasn't a high bar to clear. 

But it actually was pretty fun. It's kind of old-fashioned (teenagers in the 90s would have it as their favourite movie), and silly at times, but it's got some laughs, some of the action look cool, and most of the characters avoid being total cliches. 

I'm not sure whether it crosses into the realm of "good movie", but if the concept appeals, a person who wants to like this might actually enjoy it. Kind of like how the Jurassic World movies suck but people who like watching dinosaurs cause havoc enjoy it. 

Tom Hardy is remarkable though. He makes choices as an actor that you'd swear wouldn't work, and would result in most actors winning a Razzie, and somehow makes it into a legitimate strength of the film. Similar to Bane, you wouldn't think this performance would be right, but it is. 
2018-10-06 20:26:18 I went in with no expectations. I usually enjoy even the "worst" movies at least for a once over.

I don't care about the origin story being different or no Spiderman. Nor do I care about the PG-13 rating. I do feel R would have made more sense and built a better narrative for Venom himself though.

The very first thing I noticed was how flat and sometimes even bad the acting was. That scene where they had date night... I had just read this interview that said Michelle Williams was some award winning actress. None of that was here. The only sort of good acting was the scientist lady (money pleeeeese) and Tom Hardy. And I can't tell if Hardy's acting was good because he didn't have to play a serious role. He had to act unusual and outlandish which is a lot easier to pass off than acting normal.

Most of the story was uninteresting. Didn't care about Eddie and Anne's relationship. Didn't care about the generic villain. A lot of people commenting on how they liked the interaction of Venom and Eddie. I thought it was terrible. They had Venom was saying lines he'd NEVER say. A turd in the wind? Ya feel me? So many more.

There's a line where he says the reason he changed his mind is "because of you, Eddie". Why? They didn't show any bonding at all. The only scene where they do the thing where they try to show the Earth is worth saving to the enemy is he climbs a building and says the planet is beautiful. Looking at BUILDINGS.

They make Eddie a submissive, meek pushover. In VENOM. Venom himself isn't that impressive. He's not really that scary. You never even get the feeling that he's capable of being an uncontrollable killing thing. 

In the comics/cartoons they show the two as basically you can't tell where Eddie stops and Venom starts. This one the two are clearly two different personalities. No internal conflict of Eddie trying to do what's right but also trying to resist the urge to use this power to fulfill his primal desires.

They did the thing where the villain is just a bad version of the hero. 

Some other little things too that are more nitpicks. Like the best thing this bazillion dollar company could come up with is drones that HURL themselves at their target? Or Anne and Dan are both just OK with seeing a human literally turn into liquid, writhing mass of teeth? Eddie's accent changing throughout the movie? The whole thing is trying to find a match for the symbiotes because non-matches die within minutes but Riot and Venom can jump from host to host and the hosts are fine?

By the time they showed the dog, I knew it was coming. I knew it was gonna be THAT kind of movie. And when they showed the dog looking at the vent I was saying to my friend next to me "please don't go in the dog please don't go in the dog". I just wanted it to have at least that much respect for itself.

Last but not least the CGI was TERRIBLE. I couldn't believe it. Venom looked like a CGI cartoon character.

That wig on Woody Harrelson at the end! Like they just went to Spirits Halloween store and got a wig! 
2018-10-05 06:38:55 Yeah, this was bad. The only saving grace was Tom Hardy had good chemistry with himself as Brock/Venom. I don’t think I’ve ever been less interested in the cast of a superhero movie. The wife, the whole “evil corporation” gang, none of them were compelling or even well acted. The pacing was abysmal (it doesn’t feel like the movie starts until it’s half over), and good lord is the plot uninteresting. I actually did like Venom’s personality, but him becoming a “hero” because he was the virgin to Riot’s chad was just hilarious to me. The action scene when the evil corporation first shows up at Eddie’s apartment and the subsequent car chase was pretty fun, but that’s the only scene I really felt like I was truly enjoying the movie in and even that started to drag a bit. The final fight was horrible, too. Having two dark monsters that can basically become liquid fight at night with quick cuts does not make for a good final action sequence. 

The problems with this movie aren’t that Spider-Man isn’t in it or that it’s not rated R, it’s that it’s a technical mess in almost every regard. 
2018-10-05 09:22:33 This movie is plagued with tonal inconsistencies, terrible editing, a rushed pace that somehow actually never goes anywhere. Characters are tossed and removed without any real purpose. Not a single character has any reactions to the things they are doing. It's an incredible waste of a movie, considering the effort they went through to make Venom work, which he did. 2/10. (1 for Hardy, 1 for Venom)
2018-10-05 12:54:57 Big. Dumb. Silly. Stupid.

Made me laugh and I enjoyed it. Felt like I was 13 years old again and loving goofy stuff.

I think they inadvertently made an entertaining movie. The first act was weak. Standard stuff on top of bad writing. The story wasn't there.  It was only when Venom started talking to Eddie that the it took off. I had a smile on my face for the last hour. I wasn't laughing at the jokes, I was laughing at how serious they were taking everything and laughing at it.

More memorable than most superhero movies that I've seen, only because how over the top it got.
2018-10-05 21:48:12 It was awful but Venom is straight up sexy so once he was in the picture it became pretty watchable.
2018-10-05 22:24:39 The build up could have been better. Once Venom takes over Eddie. Honestly pretty dam good. That chase was a lot of fun and imo the movie never let up after that scene. 
2018-10-05 23:55:29 Cut the first 30 minutes (possibly replacing it with the stuff tom hardy liked) and this would be one of the top movies of the year in my opinion. Critics are so so so far away from the audience on rotten tomatoes. All my friends loved it and I think its pretty good but before Venom comes into play it’s pretty bad. I find it incredibly interesting that the audience score on rotten tomatoes is higher then A Star is Born’s
2018-10-06 03:03:58 I really don't feel like it deserved as low of a rating as it's getting. It was pretty enjoyable to me. Not a perfect film by any stretch but I went in with very low expectations and came out pretty pleasantly surprised by it.
2018-10-06 06:42:15 Just enjoyed a fun movie. Ignore the critics guys. For Causal movie goers  welcome.
2018-10-06 07:29:13 Very good movie. Beginning had weird pacing and was kinda boring. But the Venom parts were just awesome. It was a little cliqued and it isn't the best. Would rate it a 6.9/10
2018-10-06 08:11:15 I went in expecting a fun comic book movie. I got a fun comic book movie. Critics need to lighten up and not take every film seriously.
I give it a solid B. 

2018-10-06 10:02:29 Okay so I never realized until this movie came out how much people say how much they dislike a movie without saying why. So many reviews were like politicians avoiding expanding on any detail or criticisms. Then everyone was saying "exactly what I expected, awful. Very disappointed." As someone who never grew up reading comics, watched any superhero movies or shows, I enjoyed the movie. The one major issue I had was one character flaw in my opinion. >!While I'm okay with Venom being a loser on his planet, I thought he was supposed to be more of an antivillain as  opposed to a foreigner who's just dealing with culture shock after moving to a new place that isn't okay with murder or cannibalism. Combine that with the overly cheesy "I've decided to change my mind about this planet, because of you Eddie" it was just too mushy for this movie. I think it would have been really easy for Eddie to just convince him to not kill and eat any random person because if he did the entire planet and it's army would eventually gun him down. Self preservation as a means to hold him off from eating anyone he wants would make more sense than Eddie making his heart grow 3 sizes bigger.  !<There was a few minor issues here and there like the fucking drones trying to Kamikaze Eddie when they were strictly instructed to make sure he comes back alive but overall nothing major?  


Can anyone explain why this movie is hated as much as it is? I simply don't understand it and the only conclusion I can draw is because it's not following the comics to a T and it's non canon or something.
2018-10-06 15:04:04 I loved the fact that they kept Spiderman out of it. 
2018-10-07 08:18:36 Honestly this movie is comedic gold. So many bad choices happen so abruptly, it’s fascinating.
2018-10-08 03:32:58 Bleh. It's Marvel material but definitely not Marvel quality. The movie tries to be sci fi, horror, comedy, action, and romance genres all at once. Also, there really isn't much in the way of plot development... It feels like a very generic movie to me. 😕
2018-10-08 08:24:05 Really, really liked this movie. Personally, I’ve been sick of superhero/comic movies for a long time. But this character was very fun, exciting, and funny. Very excited to see it more in the future. 

The chase scene might have been the worst part of the movie for me, but even that scene was still fun for the most part. Didn’t like Annie at first either, but by the end I was actually ok with her and kinda want to see what they do with her in the future. 
2018-10-05 06:16:56 When I first heard Jenny Slate's characters name I thought she was called Dr. Skirt and I thought, wow that is unfortunate.  
2018-10-05 06:25:01 The poll was pretty funny. Mods, please do more like that.
2018-10-05 06:51:10 This was much better than I expected based on Tom Hardy distancing himself from it earlier this week.  It's fun at least, the chase scene was good, the final battle was cool, and Venom is funny.  The pacing isn't great (it felt like there should have been about 15 minutes more before the final battle), the evil corporation stuff doesn't really go anywhere, and [Venom just deciding he likes Earth and doesn't want to destroy it](#spoiler) is really flimsy (although I don't know the comics well, that might be true there also), but it's enjoyable.  I was a bit surprised that I didn't miss Spiderman, given how intertwined Spiderman and Venom are in the comics. 

Also, for those who haven't seen it, there are two post-credit scenes, so stay all the way to the end.
2018-10-05 07:30:45 Does the laboratory not have cameras...Eddie just walked around without even trying to hide. Why did they need to interrogate the woman?
2018-10-05 09:29:58 imo they needed to condense the intro of the film. Once the Doctor reached out to Brock for help to reveal what was happening was when the movie truly started for me. Had a blast from that point on
2018-10-05 09:45:08 This movie was fun and perhaps not deserving of ratings that low. Sure it wasn't a masterpiece but it definitely held its own and made the theater laugh several times.
2018-10-05 17:36:15 So was there a Tom Holland cameo or what?
2018-10-05 19:25:35 Which superhero movie would you compare it too. It terms of good,average,ok ,bad 
2018-10-06 00:43:38 Much better then I expected. However the CGI was pretty distracting and the film really would’ve benefited from an R rating. All the talk about “heads being bit off” got old when there wasn’t a drop of blood in the whole movie (minus credit scene).

Hardy did great, though.
2018-10-06 01:07:59 A bit of a meh film in my opinion. It wasn’t as bad as I was lead to believe by some reviews but I couldn’t help come away with the feeling that the film could have been so much more with better writing.

It had a bit of an identity crisis between going for horror or leaning towards comedy and I think the humour was a little over done and fell flat at some points. Wasn’t a fan of the CGI in a few fight scenes too.


Over all I don’t regret seeing it but I wouldn’t watch again.
2018-10-06 09:02:35 Remember: every scene where they say "symbiote" or "symbiosis" was revoiced, at the least.
2018-10-06 09:53:48 The whole movie was pretty good but this easily could have been a Blue Beetle movie. 
2018-10-06 13:28:19 Honestly I don't get all the hate that movie gets. It wasn't a mind blowing cinematic masterpiece, but it was a very fun movie to watch. If you like superhero movies with some humor you're gonna like this. I loved the casting. Tom Hardy absolutely killed it. Riz Ahmed was great for that role (playing something very different from rogue one), and the entire casting felt very in-place and natural. The action scenes were amusing as well. The fact that they didn't make it as edgy as the trailer made it seem was a relief from me, cause that would be kinda cringy. 
2018-10-06 17:36:28 I just find everything leading up to it's release to be confusing.

I thought the whole point of not having Spiderman involved at all was because the studio wanted to jump on the Deadpool hype train and were aiming for that R rating, but then they dropped it to PG a few weeks before release? Uh?

There's so much wrong with the movie. So many dumb decisions were made but Hardy's conversations with himself and the symbiote are great. Even though I have a great deal of issues with it... I still enjoyed it. I really want to slam it because of the things I dislike about it but in the end it's just... dumb fun? It's like the Fast & Furious movies. I know they're so bad but at the same time I still enjoy watching them.
2018-10-07 04:36:23 I really loved the movie. The fight between Venom and Riot was awesome! Now for the casting of Carnage...anyone else feels like Woody isn't a good choice? And his hair looked awful. You could clearly see it was a wig. 
2018-10-07 09:16:19 If it does happen will they introduce this venom into Spider-Man and how? 
2018-10-08 03:38:10 Man, I hope the sequel (this made a ton of money) is a comedy of Eddie and Venom raising their symbiote baby together. Sony, bring that to the big screen. SHOW ME THEIR ROMANCE.
2018-10-08 07:55:57 Much better than I expected. 
2018-10-08 12:00:34 Mask. Copy! - Best Line Ever!
2018-10-10 06:36:12 Re-release the movie, but dub all of Venom’s lines with Bane’s accent.  I’d buy that for a dollar!!   How epic would that have been.   Talk about a missed opportunity.
2018-10-11 23:51:41 One note I'd make about this movie is the lack of focus on Venom as a "non-super hero", contrary to what all the marketing for this movie suggested. I loved seeing my favorite comic book character on screen in a way that I thought did him justice, but by the end of the film was just a run of the mill superhero that occasionally will kill someone (out of hunger, not because he's inherently bad)
2018-10-15 06:58:29 I just saw it and didn't like it a lot, tell me if I'm wrong with something but, here is my opinion.
(Sorry if my english is not good enough)

My main problem was Eddie, his character didn't developed at all, I mean, I didn't think he had any motivation at all, more of an obligation because he was the host, and ultimately because he wanted to save the planet, and that seems like an easy excuse to be a protagonist. On behalf of his personal life, he got what he wanted at the end, a job, but that's it, he didn't need to learn something in his life, I mean the character didn't need development, and that's a simple, if not a poor protagonist.

Venom was a good character but poorly executed in my opinion, he was a looser in his planet and liked the planet Earth because of Eddie, maybe feeling that he could be someone of importance in this world, but I don't think that this was showed enough or right, his relationship with Eddie wasn't deep at all, but changed his nature very easily. On the other hand, his nature as an eating human fucking monster wasn't showed enough or right, he seemed more like the cute alien pet of Eddie, but that isn't necessarily bad, maybe I wanted a more serious and cruel Venom, other that a comical alien.

Anne was just ok, her character didn't developed a lot other than ending up being friend with Eddie, maybe ta change will happen in a sequel, but here she was just a female needed to fill the love interest of the protagonist, she did help defeating Riot, but that could have been done with anyone. Maybe her major contribution was helping Venom change his mind about Earth.

The villains were cool, they weren't super deep or anything, but I don't have any problem with them.

The action scenes were cool too, and the scenarios and photography and everything else too.

Overall it was enjoyable, but with mayor flaws. I too think that the critics are being too harsh.
I'm not an expert in movies or anything, but that was my perception, and I haven't seen the movie a second time, so please fuck me up and point out if I'm wrong with something, I would love to know I someone thinks different.





2018-10-28 23:12:02 I liked the movie a lot. I thought the first 30 minutes or so were very slow though, but the chase scenes afterwards more than made up for it. 7 or 8/10
2018-10-29 03:05:33 Just saw this movie today. To be honest, it was a lot better than I expected. I liked it and I'm looking forward to future installments. I'm excited to see Carnage.
2018-10-05 07:00:41 I had fun, overall looking forward to seeing carnage in the sequel. could do with a less confusing action between Venom and Riot.

theater was packed, so It's almost guaranteed to do well in terms of sales. 

Basically it's like suicide Squad, critics and R/movies hate it, but it's still going to get a sequel because money matters, not ratings.
2018-10-05 07:20:31 The movie took its time to start, they explained the nature of these "parasites" at least four times.

The movie could have been much, much better, but its not as bad as the critics are saying.
2018-10-05 11:03:25 I enjoyed it. It's a shame it's getting ravaged, but I had fun.
2018-10-05 12:55:13 If, by now, you have learned not to expect a compelling narrative/story from movies consisting of man-eating monsters, you will enjoy this movie.

I went in expecting dumb, CGI filled action involving Venom tearing some assholes a new asshole. And this movie delivered. My only gripe is that the final fight (which was fucking spoiled by the trailers) had CGI so muddled i couldn't tell what the fuck was going on. If that was a narrative decision, it was a poor one.

Okay, and another gripe is that Tom Hardy sounds autistic in this.

Otherwise, fun, dumb action movie.

Edit: The turd in the wind line actually made me laugh a little, it aint that bad

7/10
2018-10-06 17:33:33 I saw Venom yesterday and totally enjoyed it. I went with zero expectations given the very negative reviews I observed on Rotten Tomatoes. It may not be the greatest movie based on a Marvel character, but it had good moments and doesnt justify the initial hate it received IMO

I think many people have similar views given its good showing thus far at the box office. The movie certainly could have been better but isn't the shittiest comic book movie of all-time as many critics perceived. Keep an open mind
2018-10-10 05:18:52 The scene in Anne's car - when they are racing Eddie back to the hospital - where Venom just out right announces his weaknesses, this was some serious lazy writing.

Venom - *"Sound harms us."*

Anne - *"So it's like your Kryptonite?"*

Venom - *"Fire also hurts us...and shellfish...we're also lactose intolerant."*
2018-10-05 06:25:25 A solid not bad. It was like a deadpool-lite. Goofy and silly but fun and entertaining. Not Shakespeare, in fact I'd call most of it bad writing...and yet it's just undeniably fun.
2018-10-05 06:27:43 I really liked Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and I liked the Venom personality, I thought it was very entertaining. I had a lot of fun with it. It was good characters in a shitty movie.

The movie had some rough parts but I think with the right director and producers it could be good.

I wish we got to see the R rated original concept though.
2018-10-05 11:57:17 My SO dragged me to the movie as I didn't want to see it due to the bad reviews both in reddit and metacritic. I don't get why, it's a very enjoyable movie.
2018-10-06 00:34:05 Upgrade was better as a "Venom" film than this film. 

Also, a $100m production budget but such sloppy CGI. Ugh. 

&#x200B;

A-List makes me not feel bad about going to this, though. 
2018-10-16 20:52:48 This definitely deserved the bad reviews. Pacing was horrendous, dialogue was shaky at best, characters’ motivations were questionable, and I just felt like everyone except Reid Scott phoned in their performance. Riz Ahmed wasn’t nearly scary enough and from the beginning, I thought he had been miscast. I don’t know, why can’t we just have a good Spider-Man movie with Venom in it? 
2018-10-07 06:53:04 It definitely doesn’t deserve a below 50% rating, but I get it. A lot of those critics barely understand the superhero genre, much less the antiheroes and part time villains of it.

This is a movie for the fans, not for the general audience. The pacing is at times irritatingly slow or mindboggingly quick, so its easy to miss an important line. The lighting was right for the mood of the film, yet not so dark that it takes away from the scenes. Well rounded origin story; a little aggressive with Freddie’s “life”. I’m betting the girlfriends portrayal may not go overwell, but it is better than MJ from spiderman as far as realism. 

Great film for those who like the antihero archtype, which is my favorite. I’d give it an 8.4/10 with the most similar film being Deadpool which is a 8.9/10 for me. 
2018-10-05 07:04:18 I liked it! Good action and effects, the story line is a little weak and the first act struggles in setting up characters but overall I enjoyed it!
2018-10-05 10:04:05 I thought the film was pretty solid. Even though I wanted a little more from it. Felt like it could have benefited from an R rating. That way, Venom wouldn't be holding back. I can only hope for an extended edition with those 40 minutes Hardy loved, or maybe an unrated edition of the movie. 

BTW, anyone know the name of the song playing after the mid credits scene? 
2018-10-05 15:01:57 The first act of the film made me think I was gonna hate this movie, but I ended up enjoying it a little. It's riddled with cliches, stupid lines, and mediocre cgi, but I still thought it was fine. My favorite part of the movie was the Into the Spider-Verse clip at the end credits. Both Hardy and Venom were good too. 

EDIT: Changed a few words.
2018-10-05 18:34:01 hopefully spidey appears in the sequel
2018-10-05 19:06:36 Michelle Williams is a great actress, but even she couldn’t hide the fact that she didn’t want to be there.
2018-10-06 00:44:41 It was okay at best. Venom when he is with Tom Hardy is great and is the best part. Any scene without these two is terrible. Action was okay other then the final fight scene which I couldn't even follow it was a CGI mess. Big problem was Venom is just a Hero. Not an Anti-hero just didn't feel right. Overall 5/10 a rent at best.
2018-10-06 08:35:12 As someone really invested in Spiderman and this particular arc, I wasn’t impressed by the story or character journey. The fuck does Eddie Brock learn at the end, that he forgot to say sorry?

You can do a Venom story without Spiderman fo’ sure, but thy were unable to keep a grasp on the compelling loser-to-evil-jealous-monster character regression that Venom brings out in Brock.
2018-10-06 14:53:36 Well, solid 6/10 for me. Not as bad as the critics said, but definitely a fun time. I'm seeing criticism over the final battle as being hard to follow due to the night time and shaky cam, but am I the only one that was able to see everything clearly even though its a bit fast? Its still underwhelming though. 
2018-10-07 07:25:09 Gonna chip in here, If I had to compare the movie to other marvel films, I would rate it alongside the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Ant-Man. It starts off a bit rocky when establishing who Eddie is however once Venom comes into play the movie kicks into gear and becomes really fun and enjoyable. I really hope Marvel Studios is willing to work with Sony to bring this iteration of Venom into the MCU, Timeline wise it would have to take place before the first Avengers movie. Overall I give it a solid 7/10 because the start is a bit slow till Venom comes into play.
2018-10-07 08:17:23 At first I couldn’t fathom the idea of a venom story without Spiderman. But then I realized how shoved down my throat Spiderman has been. Toby, Andrew, and Tom. I think it was better without. In the same way I really don’t want a Hulk focused movie ever again. But... opinions. 
2018-10-08 01:35:28 This movie did not bomb as most here expected. Will most likely get a sequel.
2018-10-08 08:34:44 I saw the reviews and got scared but I actually liked this one. The villain is very forgettable and it needs to focus more on Eddie and Venom's bond. Nice popcorn flick though better than Sony's previous attempts at comic book movies. This movies critic reviews are a bit lower than I think they should be. I wonder what they're going to do with that Carnage post credits since Venom seems profitable.
2018-10-10 17:07:50 I absolutely loved Hardy in this role and the banter between he and Venom was so much fun. It's a shame that everything else was so bad. My first thought when leaving the theater was that I was so sad they wasted Hardy's Venom on this disaster of a production. You just cant help but feel disappointed for what could have been such a fucking awesome flick. Slap an R-rating and go super-gore, get a good script/director, and a WAY better editor to pace the movie way better (what the hell was up with the firstnight 30min giving me both whiplash and dragging? How is that possible) and damn it would have been a memorable ride. It's a shame it ended up being just a meh popcorn flick, but I still enjoyed it and would see the sequel for Tom Hardy alone.
2018-10-11 23:20:32 I somehow spent the majority of the last half alternately laughing at the movie and pitying it.  What an absolute mess 

Please give us an extended rate R cut to see what could have been 
2018-10-12 08:19:36 it wasn't that bad. Enjoyable for the most part.
2018-10-05 07:54:04 I went in not expecting much but *man* did I enjoy that. So did my buddy that came with me.  The action was entertaining and Venom was an enjoyable character to watch. That said, I'm looking forward to the next movie and hopefully future others. 
2018-10-05 10:00:45 I think this was the best way Sony could have made Venom without a Spider-Man background
2018-10-05 11:34:31 This movie was really effective at showing the mentality of an anti-hero. You see Eddie grow as an individual and a man as he learns to accept that “life is painful.”

Brock isn’t a *bad guy*, but he’s not Peter Parker. 

Venom on the other hand... I’m still undecided. I feel like I could definitely see Brock taking on a hatred for the Spider given enough time with the symbiote. 

It’s hard for me to put aside my knowledge of the character from the comics/ cartoons and the idea of seeing Tom Hardy face off with Tom Holland kinda makes me giddy so excuse me for really thinking that Sony is on to something big here. I don’t know how we’re going to end up with a connected universe but I’m hoping for an eventual showdown on *Battleworld* just for continuity sake. 

2018-10-05 11:44:08 They should have just had Elon Musk play Riz Ahmed's role.
2018-10-06 00:59:48 Venom is badass, Tom Hardy is an incredible actor

Story is rushed and forced though, only Eddie/Venom really matter, every other character is forgettable


2018-10-08 10:28:02 Is there anybody on here at all who DIDN'T like this movie? Every last comment is someone saying "I had a blast, critics were wrong!" I think this is the majority opinion. Nobody seems to think this was an absolute dumpster fire.
2018-10-07 08:27:25 Yeah, this movie is getting some really unfair critical reviews.

It's a solid 8 movie. I had more fun watching it than a handful of the Disney Marvel films.

I honestly don't know what is up these critic's asses. This movie deserves at least a 60% or 50% critic score.

It makes good use of Venom's comic book material. It has a lot of fun nods to fans.

It was a simple and easy to follow plot. It had simple to understand characters, and was actually really good at establishing the settings.

It is a very coherently directed movie, even with the cuts keeping it PG-13.

The humor is there. The action is there. The dialogue is cheeky, but acceptable.

Like I have seriously seen much worse movies with better scores. The dumpster fire Transformers movies come to mind.

I think the effects were acceptable. The ending fight was a bit of a CGI mess, but it wasn't too shabby.

Also spoiler, Woody Harrelson is Cletus Kasady in the post credit end. It was a bit miscast for me, but still really cool.

If Sony managed to get it into the MCU, it would probably still work.

But yeah, ending my rambling, it's a solid 8/10. I dig it.

Edit: To add on, a lot could have been better. Yes I wish Spider-Man eas was involved.
I'm a diehard Venom fan. I have his solo comics. I own the lethal protector mini-series this is based on.
It could be deeper in terms of character development. I get it. I really do.
Still think it was solid. 
2018-10-07 06:16:44 it was better than anything DC has put out so far...excluding WW 
2018-10-05 20:09:04 Yes the movie had some poor dialogue. Yes the side characters weren't really fleshed out. Yes the first act was pretty weak. 


I freaking enjoyed this movie! 


The movie wasn't technically great but even it's ''downfalls'' made it more endearing. I loved the interactions between Eddie and Venom and the scenes where Venom acted as Eddie's wingman were hilarious. Venom looked cool as hell and I loved the action scenes. The movie was surprisingly funny and the cinema died with laughter when he told his neighbour to turn off his music. Eddie Brock/Venom is one of my favourite movie superheroes now. I love how he's so flawed yet loveable and I feel that he has a very realistic reaction to gaining superpowers that we haven't seen in other movies. I found the scene where Venom reveals that he's a loser on his planet funny but also charming as the movie makes this host/symbiote relationship work. All the flaws in this movie actually made it more entertaining such as the weird scene where Eddie impersonates E.T and the ''Turd in the wind line''. 


Venom is a legit top ten comic movie for me and that's no joke. I was seriously entertained by this movie. Venom is a bizarre case where the negatives of the movie actually make it more endearing. 
2018-10-07 23:34:48 This was a mess from beginning to end. Terrible plot, great performance from Hardy but his was the only one. Music was solid so that's something. 

Remember... LET THE DEVIL IN. 
2018-10-08 01:28:35 I went and saw this movie. It was fine. I dont know why people are acting like it's the worst movie ever. It was not as good as infinity war but it's an origin story. How good do you expect it to be. It was just as good as thor or spiderman or Dr. Strange's origin story. It was not the greatest movie ever but it was completely fine for an origin story.
2018-10-08 19:33:35 This movie is as underrated as Black Panther is overrated. Go with the audience score on this one. I and everyone I know who saw it enjoyed it. Is is flawed? Yes, but it doesn't deserve the hate it's been given.
2018-10-10 17:24:02 30% on RT makes me seriously doubt the integrity of the critics on RT

it was perfectly serviceable and enjoyable

people are judging it unfairly by late-MCU standards
2018-10-05 23:23:26 Gotta be honest. I really liked it and enjoyed it! Dunno why there are hates, but I found it rather entertaining and am glad it didnt take itself that seriously.
2018-10-07 08:45:59 Oh fuck, my eyes. That final battle made Transformers: revenge of the fallen's look like duel of the fates in comparison. 

Although, I hope this eventually turns into the Rocky horror picture show for comic book movies, because it is so insane and hilarious which would make an event like that super fun.

2/10 Turds in the wind.
2018-10-05 12:02:54 This is the best review of the movie so far:

#VENOM is the THE ROOM of superhero films. Both films take place in San Francisco, both are loaded with painful cringe-worthy dialogue that feels like placeholder for the real thing, and both have an insane, manic central performance that kind of make them worth checking out.
2018-10-05 22:21:36 I loved this movie so goddamn much, I'm seeing it again. I kept wondering why I was the only one in the theater laughing so much, especially during the lobster scene. I do feel like the first twenty minutes before the time slip were unneeded. They felt like they were reshoots, and didnt match up to everything happening (and the rest of the movie gives enough context). Like Annie saying they'd been broken up a month instead of 6. Or the same asian lady being alive for 6 months before switching to the little girl.

The movie came back from 2004 to remind us of a simpler time, when people still used the newspaper for the classified ads.
2018-10-07 04:05:37 Easily in my top 5 of 2018 so far.
2018-10-05 06:27:34 I'm really glad that there was some payoff to Eddie's conflict with his loud neighbor.  Really necessary stuff that.  
2018-10-05 06:44:42 This movie screams reshoots. The opening thirty minutes feel different in tone and style than the rest of the film. The key evidence is that Eddie recounts the events of the whole opening of the film after the six months later bit. It feels like we're supposed to meet Eddie at the lowest point and work our way out of it through interactions with Venom all those interactions are missing. Remember when Tom Hardy said his favorite forty minutes were cut? I wouldn't be surprised at all if that's the entire getting to know each other part. Saddest part is that I really like the venom and Eddie bits. I think Tom Hardy plays a really good version of the character.
2018-10-05 06:59:01 Not bad, definitely had some moments that obviously were either rushed or cut weird and a few awful line reads but overall not terrible but definitely not as good as it could have been.
2018-10-05 07:01:04 I wish this movie features on one of upcoming Best of the Worst episode.......
2018-10-05 07:08:14 okay i was in the first showing anywhere near me as a i felt i had to be since Venom is my favorite comic book character so all my critique is biased by that. i thought it was pretty good, i liked how they made the Venom symbiote funny, it fit in well and kept the tone from getting too dark which was good. i thought the final act came on too fast though, the climax just kind of apears out of nowhere and i feel the film would have been better with about ten to fifteen minutes of actual bonding between Eddie and Venom before the symbiote decides to turn traitor on its entire species. 
2018-10-05 08:02:45 Whatever happened to the proof of Drake’s human experiments? They made such a big deal of him getting the phone with photos to his old bosses office then never came back to it...
2018-10-05 08:57:50 Honestly: I liked it
2018-10-05 09:18:40 I thought it was good. Didn’t really read any of the ratings or anything but I enjoyed it. I am a marvel noob and don’t have any knowledge of venom and I enjoyed it. I just wish the drake guy got his justice as drake not riot. If that makes sense. Kind of more story about how they got proof of the tests he was doing on people 
2018-10-05 09:44:08 wasnt that bad, there were flaws, but it was enjoyable.
2018-10-05 23:14:54 I think the plot and pacing were about as bad as everyone says but I was so fucking entertained by Venom. He looks amazing, Tom Hardy is amazing, and purely based on visuals it was everything I could hope for. Dialogue could be worked on significantly but it's definitely better than critics said
2018-10-06 01:18:53 Haven't seen it yet(will in about a hour), I know it has bad reviews but I have a feeling I'm going to(maybe because of low expectations) enjoy this film. 

Before when this happens I go in and 'hope' the reviews are wrong, things like The Mummy, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, or Die Hard 5. But usually the hope dies fast, but for some reason I have a very positive feeling going into this movie. I'm not really even that big a fan of the character, so it's not a uber fan just clinging to hope. I just have a positive feeling I'm actually going to have fun tonight.
2018-10-06 07:57:39 This movie was pretty dumb, not going to lie, yet for some reason I kind of enjoyed it.

 The plot was extremely cliche, the villain was underdeveloped, the pacing was bad, etc. Yet it almost seemed like the movie just didn't care, it was just a funny story loosely based off a Spider-Man villain. It's the first CBM I've ever seen that's a legitimate dark comedy. It aesthetically looks and is set in a similar world to Netflix's the Punisher but takes itself about as seriously as Guardians of the Galaxy. 

I've honestly never seen anything like Venom before, and I didn't hate it, even though it was objectively a bad film in pretty much every single way. 
2018-10-06 08:18:00 I enjoyed it.  I don't remember to much about Venom from the 90s cartoon but was he always this.....silly?
2018-10-06 09:18:38 At no point was I bored, which is a plus. However, the writing, acting, and CGI were all pretty bad at various moments. I really enjoy Tom Hardy, but this wasn't his best performance by any means. I'll give it a 5/10.

That being said, that post credit scene made me lose my mind. As a lifelong comic fan, I've waited over 20 years for that. That alone has me excited for a sequel. Fingers crossed it's way better than this. Cletus fucking Kasady!
2018-10-06 14:13:11 Venom didn’t need to fight riot. He just needed to rush on ahead and reinstall three of the first stage angular velocity sensors, responsible for yaw control, in an incorrect orientation.
2018-10-07 04:26:14 They got the venom/eddie Brock dialogue down just right. Really the best part of the movie. 

I just feel like there wasn't much of a narrative or story there. Just a shamef this was all wasted on no Tom holland, because in the end they went pg13 and tom hardy's venom could've easily fit in MCU. 
2018-10-07 08:55:52 I saw this on Friday. I was hoping for Sony to recapture the magic of the early 2000s Tobey McGuire Spiderman, but without Spiderman. I am no longer the age I was when I saw that movie for the first time in theaters. I don't think they got there.  
  
HOWEVER, I believe Venom can exist in a world without Spiderman. He had a lot of things going on before that annoying boy reporter appeared. His own life. His own problems. This captured that well. Venom is the *hero* of this movie. A villain we can empathize with. They succeed here.  
  
Mid-credit scene. Never thought I'd see Woody Harrelson in such a Universe.
2018-10-07 11:49:43 I honestly really liked the movie. I went in thinking it was going to just suck, slow start but shit picked up quick. That credit scene got me good.  I enjoyed it a lot 
2018-10-08 03:21:26 This movie was decent, not great by any means. Pacing seemed slow in the first act and his initial transition to Venon seemed so quick I couldn’t really appreciate it. A lot of the shots were jarring in a way that appeared to me try to cover up for a lack of good dialogue and shot choices. The ease in which he got into the lab upset me. Carlton Drakes character seemed miscasted, I get they were trying to go for the Sillicon tech billionaire amoral banal evil type of thing but it didn’t feel real or even comical in a good way. Something about the direction didn’t make me feel tension or anxiety that I felt I should of had. Tom Hardy and Michelle Willams did the best with what they had.  
2018-10-08 18:40:18 I surprisingly enjoyed it, especially when I told myself that Eddie had some form of autism or social anxiety and that's why  his speech was so weird. It became more relatable and enjoyable then, lol.
2018-10-09 19:57:40 My first thoughts immediately after watching is that it's just bland. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty forgettable. It definitely felt rushed; the pacing was odd at times... You know that feeling of euphoria you get leaving the theatre after watching a great movie? It just wasn't there.
2018-10-11 22:30:49 I was thinking. It would have been cool for them to work out a deal like they did with Spider-Man and this to be part of the MCU, but not announce it.  

Keep no mentions of it in the film, keep the "In Association With MARVEL" logo.  

But in a post credits scene you see Venom encountering a bad guy. And it is a big scary looking dude, one who is no match for Venom but could easily beat up Eddie. But right as Venom is going in for the kill you hear the Venom symbiote go "what the fu--" in Eddie's head as it disentigrates around him, leaving Eddie to get pummled by the bad guy, and that is how they let everyone know it is part of the MCU.
2018-10-05 07:16:55 The movie is a fun, brainless summer action flick/ride. I liked it a lot! 

Unlike Suicide Squad, it didn’t get weighed down by a mess of a plot run through a blender by a studio. 

Starts with a bang and mostly doesn’t let up. 

My only quibble is that Venom gets a little cheesy at the end when it’s time to wrap up the film. Or *ride*, as it were. 
2018-10-07 23:59:37 I actually really enjoyed the movie.  I thought Hardy was great, all the scenes with Venom were exciting and enjoyable and the plot was serviceable. Sure it has problems (Woody's wig), but I feel like the reviews (and the trailers) made me expect something A LOT worse than what we got. 7/10
2018-10-09 04:28:11 [deleted]
2018-10-05 06:12:00 I'm gonna start by saying I have no idea on the actual back stories from the comics of Venom or Eddie Brock. I don't know if that changes anything, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and do not understand all the hate it's gotten!
2018-10-05 15:19:06 So it sucks, but with the origin story out of the way we have Carnage to look forward to. If we get a sequel, that is.
2018-10-07 06:25:44 Very dissappointed, but that's to be expected since I read Rick Remander's Venom and idk if anything could top that for me. It just really felt like Eddie was being dragged through the movie, venom turns good and says it's because of eddie but we never really see why, and we get to see venom with boobs so actually it's a 10/10
2018-10-07 12:15:16 The opening shot of the space craft is some of the worst blockbuster film CGI I've seen in a looooong time
2018-10-08 10:15:52 Saw it today! Lot to unpack. Collection of random thoughts:

--Hardy just killed it. I wasn't really certain from the trailers what tone they were ultimately going for. They surprised me and subverted my expectations by turning this into almost a horror/dark comedy by spending a surprising amount of running time on giving me a detailed and well-acted portrayal of Brock. Hardy really got into this role and I felt like by the close of the first hour I understood Eddie Brock better than I did most of the characters in the MCU after they had multiple films under their belt. Great job by Hardy.

--And some surprisingly good jobs from other actors, as well. Michelle Williams was great in this. I felt real sympathy for her. Bombay Tesla was suitably unhinged. I'm not familiar with that actor, but I hope to see more from him the future. The voicework for Venom was spot-on. I did not expect for that kind of "bro banter" from Venom, and it was just delightful. The "pussy" line brought down the house.

--Audience seemed into it. Most people stayed for the mid-credit sequence.

--The initial apartment fight, subsequent motorcycle chase, and Venom reveal was surprisingly well done. I generally don't like chase scenes that eat up a lot of time, but the use of the powers was creative enough, and Hardy was entertaining enough as a guy who had no idea what the fuck was going on, that I really enjoyed it.

--They gave Bombay Tesla's symbiote (Riot ... a name I had forgotten from the comics, I figured it would be Carnage as the villain) just enough of a backstory, and Venom just enough of a reason to fight him, to invest me in the final battle. Just enough. Barely. The voicework of Venom sold the "we were going to eat your planet, but I'm tired of being a random schmuck so I think I'll just stay here and rule with you" astoundingly well considering that the speech sounds ridiculous on paper. Obviously the rocket launch thing was bizarre, but whatever ... it gave us a reason for a pretty good final fight scene.

--Did the other two symbiotes die? It seemed like it, but given their propensity to stave off death, I have my suspicions.

--I am uncomfortable with how the Michelle Williams version of Venom made me feel.

--Right up until the apartment fight scene I would say the movie had the structure, pacing, camera-work, and general tone of a horror film. From that point on its really more of a straight action comic book movie, but I was really drawn in that they actually did what they said they would do and try to be somewhat creative with the tone of these films.

--I have no idea what character from the comics Woody Harrelson was playing, but that wig was atrocious.

--Doctor Dan and Laboratory Do-Gooder could have been throwaway characters, but I felt sympathy for them, too! So many actors did so much with roles that on paper had very little to them.

--Don't get me wrong, this ain't Citizen Kane. Nor is it in the top tier of superhero films. But, it has enough surprises, invested performances, and new takes on these characters to have kept me entertained for the running time. I was really wondering if they were going to preserve the Venom head-eating type stuff, but they apparently are going to go the full anti-hero route. Okay!

--There are some scenes that without blood just were a bit ridiculous. I mean, I get it, but we really need a rating between PG-13 and R. PG-15, or something. While the Venom concept is obviously pretty gross/disturbing, the actual violence is pretty middle of the road for comic book films. The Dark Knight or Infinity War makes this look kind of tame.

Good film. We'll see what becomes of the Venomverse. I think word of mouth is going to be pretty good for this. "Dark comedy" is not a tone you really expect from a comic book movie and people are going to be entertained by something different. It certainly caught me by surprise.

2018-10-08 10:34:31 i wanted to see a venom movie, instead i got a transformers movie starring venom

i love how venom looks in this movie though, i just wish the movie wasen't a silly pile of garbage
2018-10-14 11:48:14 Am I the only one who hated seeing Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kassidy?
2018-10-05 06:07:48 It isn't as bad as everyone is saying, but it isn't good.

There were some WEIRD plot holes: Riz Ahmed owns a facility with not ONE camera? Venom just decides "hey, I like it here. Let's not destroy your planet". Action scenes were good, funny moments. But really sloppy writing.
2018-10-05 06:24:34 Tom Hardy and Venom pretty much saved this from being a complete dumpster fire. It’s surprisingly self aware without breaking the fourth wall that it’s a ridiculous 90’s comic.
2018-10-05 07:04:38 Not a fan. The fact that this high-tech research facility doesn’t have security cameras is thoughtless and lazy. Then, Venom can sense people outside the apartment door before they knock but not the drone following them? Again, thoughtless. I can’t believe we are still seeing comic book movies where the end fight is the hero verses a slightly different version of themselves. The Carnage after credits scene is also horrible. When will people learn to just make a singular and contained movie instead of trying to build sequels off of mediocrity. If this movie was rated R and leaned more into the dark humor and different ways Venom can take people down, we could have had something... 
2018-10-05 09:32:50 We've been spoiled with how good the MCU/ Nolanverse films have been that we put comic book films on a pretty big pedestal nowadays. Venom was decent but not great. Reddit way, WAY overreacted, and reading comments about what users were thinking about it, it's like people thought the movie was going to be the next Gigli.


2018-10-05 21:36:24 About the end credits scene, I didn't like Woody as Cletus/Carnage in the Ronald McDonald wig. So tired of seeing Woody in sci-fi/fantasy movies (Hunger Games, Apes, Solo, now this?). I used to think he was a good actor but I think he's degenerating like Nic Cage now. I couldn't see any character in this scene, just Woody in a wig. Cletus should've been played by Jackie Earle Harley.
2018-10-06 09:24:13 Honestly loved this movie. Pacing and writing at times were kinda shit. But it was more entertaining than several MCU movies I can think of. 
2018-10-06 18:42:38 That second mid credit scene was amazing.
2018-10-06 20:34:00 It took 6 months to get from Malaysia to San Francisco or whatever, Riot took the old lady as a host. In later parts of the movie, unless you are a good match, you die shortly after. No way is an old random lady is that good a match, and 2, the symbiote feeds off their host, so no way is the old lady strong enough to feed Riot for 6 months...
2018-10-07 09:51:19 Just watched it, was pleasantly surprised by it. Reasonably solid movie. 
2018-10-10 01:54:18 The first 30-45 mins is genuinely awful.  Just uninteresting and boring.  Once Eddie actually gets, you know, *venomed*, it's pretty fun to watch.  I can't say the writing, acting, or film-making in general gets any better, but I certainly had fun watching it, and this was still true when I saw it for a second time.  

Has anyone seen Hardcore Henry?  I got that kind of feel for it.  The writing is poor, the acting (aside from Hardy) is meh.  But I had a blast watching anyway, and I'd recommend most people go see it if you get a chance.
2018-10-11 03:33:58 Wait so, hold on a sec.

  
Why isn't Spiderman in this?  Isn't Venom supposed to be his arch-nemesis or something?
2018-10-05 06:10:59 I was pleasantly surprised. Damn was it bad, but I had so much fun.

Why the hell does it become a comedy after a half hour? This movie straight up feels like it needs an Evil Dead 2 treatment because it was genuinely/ironically (more so the ladder) the funniest "superhero" movie I've seen this year.
2018-10-05 06:46:09 I had very low expectations from the reviews, but it was a fun movie.  As a long time Venom fan from the comics, I think they really did a great job with the effects/action scenes.  Venom felt like a real bad-ass. 

Not everything has to be Shakespeare to be worth watching. 
2018-10-05 08:12:49 I love tha people are still going to go see this movie in droves. The super hero genre has been undefeated for the last decade. It's guaranteed money
2018-10-05 23:31:43 Dan from Veep is in this and his name is still Dan, so Veep and Venom are in the same universe in my head canon.
2018-10-07 07:44:07 I enjoyed it, it had it's flaws and the movie was carried by Tom Hardy a fair bit, but it definitely deserves a better than sub 50% rating
2018-10-07 08:05:08 Solid B- for me, enjoyed this, and most of the action sequences were pretty cool. Props to Dan the Surgeon for being a bro and not waving the she's-with-me-now card that used to be somewhat expected in these scenarios (there's probably a tv tropes for that, but it seems like this happens less and less now). 
2018-10-08 06:39:16 This was an aggressively mediocre movie. Did I enjoy myself? Sure. Do I ever want to see it again? Not really.
2018-10-08 08:10:06 I grew up collecting Spider-Man cards, and never read the comics. This movie was awesome fun, funny, cool effects and CGI and well acted. And that cut scene👥👥🖖🏻💪🏻!!
2018-10-08 08:22:26 i liked this movie. this venom is how venom should be, not scrawny Topher Grace venom.  8 out of 10.
2018-10-13 07:30:03 Can we talk about how the MRI thing made no sense? An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves, not the high frequency sound waves that affect Venom. Would've made way more sense if they used an ultrasound, or said that Venom's weakness was magnets.
2018-10-13 13:41:38 It was pretty good. The story is a bit generic, but characterization and humor are on point. I was opposed to the Spidermanless Spider-Man universe when it was announced, but I'd say it's better than at least 60% of Marvel movies, so it got me interested for more. 
2018-10-18 22:39:43 Do you guys have any theories/ideas why did Venom choose specifically a journalist? Please help, need it for college work.
2018-10-06 06:01:18 Some reviewer said it's a movie stuck in 2004, and while I agree, I love it for that.  It could have been better in many ways but to say it was Catwoman bad is absurd.

In terms of Marvel stuff, I'd rate this higher than shit like Iron Man 3, Thor:  The Dark World, and slogs like the first Ant-Man and Age of Ultron.

It has its flaws, heaps of them, but the important stuff worked, Hardy works, Venom going all out in a fight works (althought the end was messy for sure, but those slow-mo scenes were great).  I really hope it does well enough for a sequel and they focus in on their strengths next time around.
2018-10-17 01:57:39 Steaming pile of garbage.  


As a stand alone movie it's rushed, unfocused and badly acted.  


As an adaptation of the character, it's just awful.
2018-10-05 07:10:12 It's bad. Really bad. The first 30-40 minutes it's all just Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock bumbling around and the filmmakers wanting you to feel sorry for him. I felt nothing. Wait, I take that back. I felt annoyed and wondered where the movie was going. All the acting in this movie is just bad. Maybe it was just the script but their lines were just delivered really wooden and poorly at times. Tom Hardy just didn't deliver here. I knew Venom was going to show up and it would get better right? No. Venom's voice is really goofy sounding and not menacing at all. He has one liners that fall so flat you'll feel like you're back in 1997 watching Batman and Robin again. I'm not gonna lie though. There were a couple times I giggled but that's it. It's just not entertaining. The only time I felt like it worked was at the very end when Eddie is confident with Venom and he's telling him how their relationship is going to be. Then it all falls apart again and Venom tells Eddie to apologize for calling him a parasite. It's all just so bad and pointless. Go watch any number of MCU movies and then watch this crap. It's like night and day. 5/10....and that's being generous.

&#x200B;

Oh and Woody Harrelson at the end as  Cletus Kasady  in prison saying "When I get out.......there'll be CARNAGE" was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Just a stupid on the nose line that wasn't needed.
2018-10-08 13:42:30 Good to see this is doing well at the box office. It's getting tiring seeing critics shit on anything for not being a mass-produced MCU turd.
2018-10-05 06:41:31 Alright, Screw It... I'm sorry "Venom", I've been calling you a piece of shit for forever... I saw you tonight... And I had a great fucking time watching you lol you still weren't a good movie but you kept me entertained and that's all that matters
2018-10-05 07:58:51 There are sooo many comments being posted and upvoted in the first hour of this thread being up that all say almost the same thing:  "It's bad, but I had fun!"  It's uncanny.  I wonder how much of this is legitimate opinion and how much is straight-up astro turfing.
2018-10-06 21:05:19 I really don't get how so many people here are saying Hardy was the saving grace, he seemed absolutely terrible to me. I laughed so hard at most of his deliveries, except for his actual jokes which fell super flat for me. Overall it I would recommend it as a "so bad it's good" movie tho.
2018-10-07 03:50:48 While Tom Hardy gave it his all and clearly had a lot of fun with the role, [Venom](http://hvnreviews.com/venom/) is just a completely committee made mess from beginning to end. The script is awful, with bizarre structuring and terrible pacing. When the story finally picks up, the rest of it feels rushed. I loved watching Hardy interact with himself, but he couldn't save the rest of this total slog.
2018-10-07 09:03:16 Further proof you can't go by Rotten Tomatoes critic scores which are far too harsh for this one film. Definitely one of the better action films to come out this year.

Question, what was the deciding factor to go ahead with a PG-13 rating for such a violent, disturbing and nightmarish character even after films like Deadpool 1 & 2 and LOGAN proved that R rated superhero films can work if done correctly.
2018-10-05 16:52:21 I'm sorry but this movie was fucking awful. Reddit also liked BvS and Justice League, so keep that in mind if you're debating whether to watch this and you're surprised by the positivity in this thread. Tom Hardy gave the worst performance in a movie like this that I can remember; it was reminiscent of Ben Affleck's Daredevil. I actually did enjoy seeing it, but only in a "is this real life?" kind of way. It was made to be MST3K'd.
2018-10-05 08:06:33 That was Elektra bad.... Like Jesus Christ, I thought it was worse than Batman and Robin
2018-10-06 21:31:04 Just really bad. Like comically bad. Wait til the fight scenes come out on YouTube if you’re into that shit. They were pretty bad too. But yeah acting, writing, cinematography, tone, all laughably bad. Tom hardy did what he could with what he had, but it was so little to work with. Most of the exposition scenes i was laughing at how bad it was written. The bad guy was so shitty. Felt like i was watching a parody. If this came out 10 years ago they might have gotten away with some of the shit like the terrible dialog or the piss poor cgi but it would still be a terrible movie. The rotten tomatoes score is a blessing, it should be *much* lower
2018-10-05 07:09:52 So did that story about Tom Holland being on set turn out to be true? Was he in the movie at all? 
2018-10-05 07:27:55 Also during the chase scene: "what is this a jeep in factory?"

As much as  I loved a lot of the action it did suffer from the number of cars/people seemingly varying wildly from moment to moment
2018-10-05 09:53:04 How long is Venom in the film for?
2018-10-05 13:18:55 What ever happen to Dora Skirth? Last scene of her was when Skirth told drake she was with Eddie, drake locked her in the room with the symbiote.
2018-10-05 16:42:18 Seeing this in a couple of hours is there an actual post-credits scene or is it just a mid-credits scene? 
2018-10-06 03:19:41 It was surprisingly interesting 
2018-10-06 06:56:08 Was the blond girl in the airport sitting by the restroom and wearing a white hoodie an easter egg for Spider Gwen?
2018-10-06 09:13:38 I wouldn't say it was good, but I actually enjoyed the movie. A lot more humor than I expected, which at first seems pretty weird tonally, but honestly was the most enjoyable part of the movie. The interactions between Venom and Brock were by far the best and most interesting parts and I wish we had seen some more of it. It seems like a decent amount of quality Brock-Venom time was cut, with Venom randomly changing his motivations out of nowhere.
2018-10-06 12:21:04 Its a a fun film tbh. Notnas great as the latest Marvel movies. But I kinda liked it.

I hope we get more. And soon incorporate it with Spider-Man 
2018-10-06 12:33:05 so what was up with the Into the Spider-verse end credits scene?
2018-10-08 14:16:24 Can someone explicitly describe what the head-biting scenes look like? Are they bloody? Do we see the remaining body? or the separated head? 
2018-10-08 18:56:48 Just came from the movie.It's not that bad.Just a generic superhero movie with some funny moments in it.Hardy did good in the role of Eddie.If you have time and want to watch a normal movie go and see it.The last fight was kinda overloaded in cgi.Most likely will get a sequel.
2018-10-08 22:47:23 an enjoyable ride, if a little weak on story
2018-10-08 23:39:33 This has been bugging me so I'll just say it. When the bad guys are about to catch venom, the leader radios in: "all ground vehicles movie in!" And I just found that phrasing incredibly weird. I mean, did they have helicopters or something? Maybe you shouldn't have destroyed all your suicide drones.
2018-10-09 02:01:14 I think the big test is next weekend. Venoms box office was great, but will it have any legs. With Bad Times..., First Man, and Goosebumps 2 all dropping next week and A Star is Born likely still bring in money, how much will these films take from Venom. Was Venom a one week wonder or can it still make bank next weekend?
2018-10-09 20:05:20 In the opening of the movie, during the scene where drake is in mission control looking at the space ship salvage.... did anyone else notice that the actors looked CG? If it was CG, it looked pretty decent, so I'm not 100% positive that the scene had CGI actors but it did look a little off for being real life actors.
2018-10-10 03:21:38 [deleted]
2018-10-14 11:59:00 Ah, I see. I guess I kind of agree what you mean with the whole transformers thing. All I know is that the noise is what made them get all weird so they were basically fighting each other and the noise. Shit even drake and Eddie joined in on the fun. I thought it was strange that they all eventually merged.
2018-11-20 05:47:37 This movie was ridiculous, but I had a fun time watching this. 

I feel like your enjoyment of the movie rests on two things: 1) How attached you are to the source material and 2) How much you like Tom Hardy/Eddie Brock

If you're super attached or didn't like Tom Hardy in this movie, there's absolutely no way you will like this; I would just find that really hard to believe. However, if you aren't attached to the source material, there might be enough campy fun in this that will win you over. 
2018-10-05 22:42:19 The Tom Hardy effect made me like this movie a lot more than I should have. 
2018-10-05 23:15:35 I really enjoyed the movie. I understand why people might not like it but I had a lot of fun with it. The back and forth between Eddy and Venom really worked for me
2018-10-07 08:39:13 This movie was fantastic! I think with some refinement it would be an amazing series. 

&#x200B;

I loved the part where Venom was first introduced fully and just bulldozed through everything and jumped in the water and took off like a rocket. I actually sat back and said to my self "holy shit" that scene I actually felt his power, like watching something on a rampage. He was fast and strong, it was awesome! When watching the hulk scenes I know he's super strong and tough but he never "felt" like he was if that makes sense? 

&#x200B;

The other scene I loved was with the police, that scene....man o man I want that on youtube asap. His method of fighting was amazing to watch, he wasn't like thor or iron man or anything we seen before. He was fast and agile, and incredibly strong. He didn't use some crazy power to take them all out like other marvel superheroes. He fought them all the way Venom actually would. 

&#x200B;

For me the movie was a solid 9/10 and I hope to god this does well so they can make a Venom 2. Also the dialogue with Venom/Brock is awesome lol. The one part were he Venom is saying put the heads in one corner and the bodies in another, and brock is like uh why. Venom's response is because that's how you are supposed to do it. It was great to show the different ways of thinking, like both of them are like looking at each other and being like WTF this guy is crazy lol.
2018-10-05 10:17:55 There appears to be a concerted effort for some reason to give this movie unfairly bad reviews and hurt its opening.  The movie was GOOD.  It was definitely worth watching.  It’s nowhere even close to the awful reviews it has received.

Song did a surprisingly good job.  Hardy is the perfect Brock.  It does a lot of cool things.  Thumbs up.
2018-10-05 17:10:22 Well it’s not bad, worth watching just lower your expectations.
2018-10-06 22:02:22 Yeah...people who said that this is Catwoman-bad just wanted to get clicks and views.

It's not a good movie, but it's just incredibly mediocre. I do feel like it's gonna get a ton of shit solely because it was always going to have people against it, but it's honestly not worth all the tantrums and rants i've been seeing on Reddit and Twitter. 

I mean really, if you let *Venom* ruin your day or piss you off, you need to watch more movies. 


2018-10-05 14:47:36 I can honestly say if you go into this with lowered expectations and think of it as a comedy parodying the superhero genre you will fucking love it
2018-10-05 15:28:27 I'm glad I don't listen to reddit and twitter. Movie was a blast, bring on Carnage! 
2018-10-05 06:28:19 U PUSSY !  
2018-10-05 09:44:18 The movie wasn’t bad I laughed when venom called him a pussy.  I also chuckled at the Stan lee cameo, when venom was asking who is that.  I am disappointed we didn’t see venom dog.  I got so excited, I thought we were about to see a venom dog.  Ala milo in the mask movies there for a minute.  Though seeing lady venom was pretty cool.
2018-10-06 23:30:48 Is this as good as **The Dark Knight (2008)?**
2018-10-07 18:04:33 I feel like everyone is coming to the agreement that the movie definitely has its moments, which i absolutely agree. My problem with it though is I feel like with all the source material and with this cast, that this is a huge waste of potential. One of my biggest gripes honestly is the fact that the original first couple of trailers, I actually thought it would have been good. I thought that the idea of this movie being dark and gritty worked which the movie actually feels like that in the beginning. However, it turns into this buddy cop movie between Eddie and Venom. Now dont get me wrong, i definitely was laughing at points in the movie but just by looking at the trailers you can tell what happened in the background. The first trailer came out and people complained so they changed the tone, then the next one came out and changed the tone, then the movie comes out and it feels like they tried to make 3 different movies. Even looking at the actors, they all felt like they were on different wavelengths when it comes to tone. Riz Ahmeds character was this cookie cutter bad guy that was supposed to be like Lex Luthor where he thinks hes doing this for a greater purpose but you never really see why. Eddie was portrayed as this amazing journalist yet he literally does the dumbest things for being so great at his job (ex. He tried to take down an entire corporation by asking him questions and name dropping people, literally giving himself away...wut). Anne and the Riot symbiote could have honestly been removed and the movie would have been the same. At the end of the day, my opinion of the movie is that it doesnt feel like a Venom movie. If you would have removed the Vemon name and the iconic face, then i think the movie could have been better. But the fact that they tried so hard to make it a "hero" movie about Venom makes it bad. Also my roommate actually bashed on me about saying that because he said that if they did that then i would have complained that "it should have been a Venom movie" which i absolutely agree but the reason I would have said that would have been because this movie is OK and if they would have made it a Venom movie (because they have SO MUCH SOURCE MATERIAL) that it could be better. Sony needs to count their blessing that they signed Tom Hardy because I think alot of people are justifying the movie since he is in it. 

5/10 - Solid meh
2018-10-06 01:12:43 It was an utter disaster. 

The only things that worked were Tom Hardy (even though he goes full Nic Cage from Ghostrider once he gets infected), Venom looked great and their banter mostly worked, and the Venom chase scene was fun in of itself. 

But that's it. 

The story is horribly cobbled together; characters get from point A to point F without really filling in the audience in what's going on. The character development was absolutely abysmal. I didn't care at all for Eddie; his relationship with Michelle Williams was undercooked, the villain was a generic corporate bad guy who turns into a generic CGI monster (bad CGI may I remind you. The CG on Venmon in *Spider-man 3* was better) and the tone was all over the place. It was bouncing back and forth between a serious monster flick to a campy comicbook movie *American Werewolf in London* style.  And the third act is easily the worst 3rd act I've seen in a film in months. It felt like someone hit the "skip chapter" button on the remote because it seemed like scenes were straight up missing. Like it felt like [there was a few scenes dedicated to Venom bonding with Eddie more and having a change of heart which lead to him eventually turning against Riot at the end](#spoiler)

I've been hearing about a Venom movie in the works for ten years, and I always knew it was gonna be bad. But I didn't know it was gonna be *this* bad. 

**2.5/10 for me**
2018-10-07 16:44:36 This sucked real hard. Even putting aside the lackluster action and shit effects/greenscreen, the plot was so poorly paced and terribly thought out.

Eddie's girlfriend's dialogue during the breakup was so on the nose. "You're stubborn and determined to tell the story over caring about people Eddie! Your actions have consequences!" Felt like something out of Black Dynamite.

So, does the LIFE foundation not having security cameras that could see Eddie and that girl enter the facility?

Did Riot take six months to realise airports exist when it's clearly established that Venom mentioned that symbiotes can see into the mind of their host?

Couldn't we cut the boring first thirty minutes out of the film? Let us see the crash scene from the start and introduce us to Eddie in that bar scene? We basically learn about how he got fired and lost his girlfriend after anyway, we didn't really need to see it. Gives us more time to expand the Venom and Eddie relationship a little and cuts down on the boring fucking intro where nothing happens. We don't need to develop Eddie and his girlfriends relationship if they don't get back together in the end.

Why did they send drones that just explode in that one chase scene? Why not equip them with stun weapons or something not stupid? Also, why was everything in that fight so blurry?!

"We are not so different, you and I." HOW IS THIS STILL IN MOVIES. IT'S SUCH A JOKE.

How was Venom a "loser," on a planet that's made up of fucking blobs? I was picturing Venom at an alien high school getting books slapped out of his hands by other symbiotes. That felt like a shitty re-dub they threw in last minute because they realised they forgot to give Venom a reason why he turns good.

Wait, why the fuck did he turn good in the ten minutes he wasn't bonded to Eddie? "Because of you, Eddie. You changed my mind." What?! How, when and why?

That entire restaurant scene was so embarrassing. Seriously, who thought any of that was funny?

Did they really do the RHINO "trailer tease is the end scene in the final film," shit again? That whole scene felt like a scene that should have been in the middle of the film.

They had a kind of funny setup with Venom turning into the dog but they didn't do anything with it.

Riz Ahmed's villain was so cliche. Right down to asking people how their kids were to intimidate them. My audience actually groaned at that.

Was there no other way to film that final fucking fight? It had to be shaky cam with two black aliens flailing around with zero stakes cos they're both invincible? It's CGI! You could literally put the camera wherever you want, but you gave it to a virtual monkey with parkinsons.

I am baffled at the mildly positive response this movie is getting here. It was a complete trainwreck. I couldn't even enjoy it as dumb fun because Venom's in it for like 15 minutes.

2/10.  Total ass.
2018-10-05 16:00:20 TLDR: It fucking SUCKS
2018-10-05 06:34:59 Lower your expectations and this is a pretty entertaining movie. 

Plot is meh, some of Tom Hardys lines are cringey as hell but I sort of enjoyed how bad they were.

It was an entertaining movie and I actually hope that a sequel is made.
2018-10-05 07:18:23 Just got back from watching it with some family members. While I wouldn't consider it one of the best CBM ever made, I had a really good time watching it and it gave me the Venom I've always wanted to see since I was 5. I can see why others wouldn't like the tone (Combining seriousness and dark humor), but for me it worked. And yes it does feel like an early 2000's CBM, but in a good way (Ala Raimi's Spider-Man).

3.5/5
2018-10-05 10:18:20 Terribly underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed it even without being a comic book fan (I liked venom in the 90s cartoon). Really funny, and not in a Guardians of Galaxy/Deadpool way where Starlord and Deadpool THINK they're very funny with their one-liners even if they don't land. Great action apart from the overly messy Symbiote clash.

The most surprising thing is they actually handled a non-spiderman origin very well. Come to think of it, Tom Holland's spider-man is too young for the traditional story to work anyway. Can you imagine a 40 year old man wanting to murder a high schooler for misleading him? Although without that anger the movie lacks an explanation as to why Brock was a good host for venom though other than luck. Seems like they bonded over being losers.

Which I think is the movie's biggest flaw, the lack of symbiote explanation/character development. People say the movie took too long to get to the action but I would have preferred more time spent on the characters.

* Why did Venom change his mind? The loser reason is reasonable I guess but they tried to hint there was a bit more to do with Brock without setting anything up.
* Was Riot using Riz Ahmed or did they share the same goals? The beginning of the film seemed to frame it more like Riot wanted revenge.
* Doesn't seem like Eddie learned anything about his self-centredness, despite Venom's best efforts. Did anyone tear up when Venom got him to apologise to Annie?
* Annie wanted to get rid of Venom, then willingly took on the symbiote, then got out of her way to give it back to Brock? Feels like missing scenes.

Say what you want about the plot though, it's infinitely better than another marvel "stop the badguy from getting the magical item" story.
2018-10-05 06:41:58 I really, really wanted to like this.  Venom is my absolute fav in the comics.  The few laugh out loud moments were simply to far and few between moments that either didn't make sense or had huge holes.  I honestly feel that they missed the mark here.  This COULD have been so fantastic, but sadly it wasn't.
2018-10-05 08:37:01 I liked it...and I *really* wasn't expecting to like it.   It was funny, the action was decent, it actually had a weird bit of heart to it, too. 

Not perfect, I can definitely see why many wouldn't dig it, but I'm surprised how much I liked it. 
2018-10-05 08:59:55 Honestly, whenever I see the words "In Association with Marvel" I just assume it's going to be shitty. 90% of the time, that is actually the case. 
2018-10-05 11:15:25 I had the lowest expectations possible, but game recognizes game, and they did a very adequate job
2018-10-05 12:51:11 I really feel this would of benefited more with being rated R and having a dark/comedy edge to it. Otherwise it feels incredibly weird venom ozzie osborn's people and no blood comes out. It's like in black panther with various people having their throats practically slashed open but they may as well of fainted.

Also they made Tom's character way too shortsighted to be worth enjoying, similarly they seemingly built up the villain to possibly talk about the deeper machinations of his ideals and desires, but then nothing happens and he is just naturally a dick. Like if it is true 40 minutes was cut, fuck if it made everything in the movie make slightly more sense.
2018-10-05 21:01:43 I really enjoyed this movie. It had its problems but Tom Hardy was great, as was his relationship with venom. Can't wait for the Carnage sequel
2018-10-06 05:14:20 So it was enjoyable enough. The first half was far better than the second. I thought the direction the writer’s took, the humor and tone for some of the scenes were just so off, unnecessary and borderline cringy. This could’ve been much better but still, it was okay overall.

2018-10-06 06:10:34 I may be a bit biased, but I really enjoyed the film. I think it was a good standalone story. It had horror with humor sprinkled in, and I thought the humor got some genuine laughs from the audience. As a huge fan of the comics, I can say that they did a good job adapting as much as they could. Lots of nods to the comics. 
2018-10-06 08:13:43 I kind of loved it. It's got one or two problems, but it's got a bigger entertainment factor than Dr. Strange, Ant-Man, and the lamer of the MCU films had for me. 

Even though the CGI is a bit sketch here and there, the action is weighty and feels great. Cinematography and sound design were high quality. Acting great all around. Character driven completely, story was really not the point, and at the end of the day good character work is what makes me happy. Humor was character based also. It doesn't really have a big message, and doesn't really pretend to. Knows exactly what it is and executes that very well.

If I put my objective hat on, probably 6-7 out of 10. Subjectively, entertainment value alone makes it an 8 for me.
2018-10-07 08:10:56 Some people liked it some didn’t. I ain’t no movie critic but I had a good time. Just finished watching it and it was a solid gut buster for someone who doesn’t know much about the Spider-Man universe or about venom
2018-10-07 12:08:27 I just saw the movie and it was pretty good. Tom Hardy is a beautiful man.
2018-10-07 15:37:02 Actually, main gripe with the pacing. So we get treated to a pretty damn long sequence of events showing how amazing Eddie and his fiancée are together, then in six months she has a LIVE IN BOYFRIEND? I guess it happens that way sometimes but I couldn't move past it. Granted the pacing was generally bad for the first forty minutes but for some reason I'm hung up on that.
2018-10-08 05:44:36 It’s a popcorn flick for sure. I’ve seen way worse movies with a better RT score than Venom. It definitely has some issues but I really enjoyed the humor, liked the dynamic between Eddie and Venom, and Tom Hardy killed it as usual. If Sony can just learn from their mistakes in this one, we could have a pretty solid sequel here. 
2018-10-08 12:00:44 It's dumb fun. I really liked the chemistry of Eddie and Venom itself, but there are parts that feel rushed or thrown together and the antagonist of the movie wasn't good. Overall, fun if you turn your brain off but below average. 4/10 for me
2018-10-11 00:15:44 I don't want to spoil anyone, but did anyone else think this is the exact plot of Kill La Kill?
2018-10-11 22:52:59 I don't know how Venom has a lower rotten tomatoes score than X-Men Origins Wolverine. Venom has 30% and X-Men Origins Wolverine has 37%. X-Men Origins Wolverine even has a higher average rating of 5.1/10 compared to Venom's 4.5/10. I can't understand how a "critic" can say that that movie is better than Venom.
2018-10-12 11:24:18 I enjoyed this movie. Most of my criticism against it has to do with the action scenes. I thought the chase scene was waaaay too long(much like this comment), definitely could've done without the drone half of it. I might've been more into it if instead of *being* the weapon they *had* weapons. It  seemed like their only purpose was to crash into things and explode. It also felt like the chase scene was the only reason they picked San Francisco, for that one shot of him on the bike. The final fight scene was visually ok, although it was kind of Michael Bay-ish at times and hard to follow/keep track of the two symbiotes. Also, a villain is usually better when they've been built up the entire movie and there's a discernible conflict(even better if the villain can maybe convince the audience that they have a viable motivation even if their actions based on that motivation might be a bit extreme), but the whole explanation for why the two were fighting came 30 seconds before the fight. That's not to say there weren't action parts that I enjoyed, just that in general that was the weakest part of the movie for me.



The humor was good, they didn't all land but most did and that's what you do with comedy, you cast a wide net knowing they won't all land for everybody. Some of the jokes I disliked might've been somebody else's favorite part of the movie.



My knowledge of Venom begins and ends with the early 90's cartoon Spiderman, but it felt like we got a good version of him here, although I don't remember Venom being so carnivorous, but hey, it was a kid's show. I thought the romance was relatively well done; as soon as I saw he had a fiance I thought for sure she was dead in the first act and so that was a nice surprise, especially for a movie widely panned as "formulaic." I also thought for sure Venom was gunna eat Mr. Belvedere.



This was a perfectly fine superhero movie and I don't know why it's sitting at 29% on Rotten Tomatoes or getting negative reviews. Honestly, aside from a better Soundtrack and being part of a larger universe I can't put my finger on why this movie is worse than *Thor: Ragnarok*. This movie had a much darker tone so it's a bit like comparing Apples and Oranges, and while I wouldn't go so far as to say I liked both equally, I also wouldn't rate one at 29/100 and another at 92/100.



I know that a RT score isn't the same as bots or trolls, but if you take away one thing as a result of what we learned recently about the backlash against the Last Jedi, let it be the importance of making up your own mind. Walk into the theater with a blank slate and I guarantee you'll enjoy more movies. Buying into hype may result in being disappointed, believing a movie is irredeemably flawed will keep you from seeing the bright spots.



Anybody else almost scream out "MONEY PLEASE!" in the theater? I had no idea she was in this and it was so tempting.
2018-10-12 23:15:25 Movie was okay at best. Definitely did not live up to the hype when venom was announced. Venom was too nice. Carrot top at the end was terribly done. I get the hair is supposed to be curly but really..
2018-10-05 15:55:28 I thought it was a really enjoyable movie. Sometimes I feel like the people who critique movies so hard are the same people from the 2/10 chin too pointy meme
2018-10-06 00:45:18 Might be an unpopular opinion but I thought this was better than Ant-man and the Wasp.
2018-10-08 08:47:36 Of course nothing can really compete with Infinity War but shit, I’d watch Venom over 75% of the Marvel Cinematic universe stuff. I had fun watching this thing. I’m tired of the bland melodrama of the MCU (besides Inifinity War because that was amazing execution of high concept stuff). People in wacky costumes spouting philosophy 101 BS is inherently silly but the MCU decides to take itself seriously — that’s why I enjoy this movie because it decides to double down on not taking itself seriously when Venom reveals that he doesn’t want to go back to his planet because “I’m sort of a loser there.” Cheers I’d give it a 7 out of 10 where’d I’d give a majority of Marvel movies a 4-6 out of 10 

Edit: ah with the downvotes. Sorry not sorry that 75% of the MCU is average paint by the numbers, take no risk adequate film fare 
2018-10-10 01:36:40 Wow, this wasn’t all that bad. Better than Black Panther imo *prepares for the massive downvotes* 
2018-10-06 04:03:40 I really enjoyed the movie. Solid 8-9 for me, there were some kind of cheesy moments but overall I thought it was really entertaining! Who else was waiting for Eminem to come on the whole movie? 
2018-10-07 21:59:39 Yeah, this movie was kind of bad. And also forgettable.

Ok, it's certainly not horrible. Not, say, Fan4stic horrible, but probably more near Spider-Man 3 bad. If I'm going to be honest, the bigger problem with this movie was that it was just so forgettable rather than just being bad.

FIrst off, the pacing and editing was borderline schizophrenic. The movie is constantly jumping from scene to scene at such an absurd pace that nothing has a chance to settle and become established and, coupled with the low effort writing and non-existent character development, makes the whole experience forgettable (and no, a character suddenly changing with no prior build up or experience does not count as character development).

Was the first 30 minutes and 6 month timeskip even neccessary? I feel that is what helped killed the pacing. As others have suggested, couldn't the movie have just started when Brock is in the bar? The movie is trying to establish Eddie Brock as some sort of down-on-his-luck loser, but he starts out as a high profile reporter whose able to get an interview with a highly influencial company, only to get fired after botching it. Honestly, there were better ways to establish him as a loser without wasting so much time. 

And speaking of which, when both he and Anne are fired from their jobs, Anne rants about Brock being "egotistical", "selfish", or something to that effect. Like, what? I feel like some scenes were missing, because the movie never really establishes Brock as any of that. If anything, he was a bit nosy and a little too curious, yes, but not what Anne described him as. 

And also, what the fuck is up with Venom being a loser on his home planet? Do symbiotes posess a similar enough social structure where such labels are valid? Keep in mind, Venom, Riot, and the symbiotes were found on a comet, so he can't be much of a loser if he was able to hitch a ride with a leader like Riot. I am not sure if this is true to the comics, but it felt stupid either way. 

Also, the climatic fight scene had some of the worst camera work I've ever seen. It was impossible to tell what was going on because both everything is moving so fast, everyone disvolves into indistinquishable blobs, and it feels like it was filmed by an epileptic chimpanzee.

On a more positive note, when the film isn't aping the romance plot from Ghost Rider or the climax from Iron Man 1, I really did enjoy the relationship between Venom and Brock and Venom's potraytal. Those 2 things for me saved the movie from entering 2/10 territory. The action, when it is not a Bayformers-esque clusterfuck, was actually enjoyable and brutal in all the right ways (as much as a PG-13 rating allows, that is). Also, I really liked Tom Hardy's perforamce, definitely miles ahead of Topher Grace from the aformentioned Spider-Man 3.

But unfortunately, that wasn't enough to ultimately save the movie. It made the movie less bad, but Venom is still, at best, a below average affair that's fun in some parts, but just boring and bad everywhere else, and just not worth continuing and ever revisiting. 4/10. 

Also, the Rotten Tomatoes score is honestly hilarious. After Redditers and Youtubers convinced themselves that critics can't be trusted and only the audience score matters for the past 10 months, seeing this shitty movie get a high score from audiences (seriously, 89% at 4.4/5? LMAO) just confirms what I've thought all along; that the people butthurt about a film they didn't like getting a high critics score and claiming they and RT are distrustful as a result are full of shit. 

Not trying to invalidate opposing opinions here; I can see why others would enjoy this movie. Just pointing out the obvious irony here.
2018-10-05 06:55:25 This was a complete dumpster fire of a movie. It felt like if the Hallmark channel did an edgy anti hero movie. Just a mess. 2/10.
2018-10-05 09:29:28 If you want to watch a great movie about a man and an entity in a symbiotic relationship that came out in 2018, **WATCH UPGRADE**

Not this film. If you wanna be frustrated with Sony and want to see an interesting Spider-Man villain get disrespected, watch venom.
2018-10-05 17:25:13 I loved the movie. It was just fun. I'm not saying it was great, more average but definitely not as bad as people are saying. I wish there wasn't so much origin stuff, it took up too much time. The films editing was all over the place. I'd like to see an extended R rated version. I would even enjoy a sequel. I'd like to see this Venom in the MCU with Spider-Man. 
2018-10-05 07:21:59 I’m a huge venom fan. He was always one of my favorite villains growing up. That said I expected this movie to be pretty bad but I actually loved it. Sure there are so pretty bad parts of the writing (have a nice life) and the villain is sort of lame pretty much being another venom and and even weaker human counter part. Anne’s character also felt alittle unnecessary in some places. I actually did enjoy the female venom bit but she seemed to just come out of nowhere in a lot of places. I did feel it took a little while until he actually acquired the symbiote but as soon as he did I enjoyed the hell out of the movie. Had some really good pieces of humor in there and all the parts with venom himself I had a huge grin on my face. I thought I’d also hate Tom Hardy’s accent but other than just a few lines I couldn’t really make out I thought it was fine. All the parts with Tom and venom interacting were great. Honestly I think we got a lot more venom screen time than I thought we would get and that’s great in my book. It’s a shame they didn’t use carnage as the villain in this one and only teased it in an after credit because who knows if we’ll even get a sequel or it’ll be an amazing spider man 2 situation and tease something at the end for it to never come to fruition. Overall I think this is a really fun pretty good movie. It’s not as good as any of the marvel movies and a lot of people probably disagree saying it was garbage but for everyone bashing it in reviews it was much better than I thought it be and enjoyed the hell out of it. 
2018-10-05 06:09:00 The movie just supports my theory that if a movie has four or more writers it’s got a 99.9% chance of being bad. 3 or under is the optimum number of writers for movies.
2018-10-05 18:32:48 I am confused by this movie.  By the end, I liked it, and would like to see more, but the first half was just weird.

Logically, it doesn't work for me. How would Venom, an alien, know enough of our language so quickly to communicate with Eddie.  I feel like there needed to be a learning curve before they could talk.

Why would Venom share his weaknesses with Eddie and ex-girlfriend?  Shouldn't he be keeping that to himself.  

Why does Venom like ex-girlfriend?  Because Eddie does?  That's lame.  Why would he care how his host feels?

And then why are so many people (ex-girlfriend, Asian store clerk) being so cool about Eddie morphing into a scary black monster and literally eating people?  

I think a tweak they should have made was that Venom be the escaped Symbiote.  That he was a rogue of his kind from the start and did not want to enslave/eat the people of earth, so he try to crash the shuttle on purpose.  Eddie then could have encountered him on the outside of the facility and they work together to stop Riot.

Venom's attitude of 'I'm here to eat everyone' to suddenly be 'I like you and this planet, I'll help you kill my leader' is just too quick.

But like I said, by the end of the movie, I wanted more.
2018-10-05 23:37:49 pretty damn good movie , i really want to see this Venom with Stark together on a scene.
2018-10-07 08:33:32 I’ve been a Venom fan since I was eight years old and I absolutely LOVE THIS FILM. I’ve seen it twice already. It nails the character, features a beautifully ridiculous performance by one of the great actors of our era, and tells an interesting story with humor and genuine enthusiasm. 

It’s a love story between Eddie and his symbiote. It’s a weird film, but Venom is a weird character. If you embrace the film for what it is—instead of fixating on what it isn’t—you’ll love it. 
2018-10-08 04:11:44 Making a Venom movie without Spider-Man is just a horrible idea. Venom resembles Spider-Man because Venom used to be his old suit. Now when Spider-Man inevitably meets Tom Hardy’s Venom there’s going to be no reason for the two of them looking so similar.
2018-10-05 06:21:39 Going into it I thought it would be really bad, but it was...fine? Fun? I don't know, I liked some things about it. I'm okay with a sequel if they fix Kasady's hair, Woody Harrelson plays a great psycho and Carnage is a great villain. Venom calling Eddie a pussy was great, actually made me laugh. They had an interesting buddy-cop vibe about them that could be cool to explore a little more
2018-10-05 07:30:51 Just like most video game movies, this [Prototype] adaption was meh. 
2018-10-05 08:58:52 The end credits has got me hyped!
2018-10-05 09:03:06 It's bad, but also kind of amazing. If you go into this movie hoping to make fun of it and open to it making you genuinely laugh then you'll watch one of the better comedy movies of 2018. 

It's a very mixed bag of a film. The acting is off-kilter, the editing awful at points, pacing issues and oh so many bad character motivations. But also it's funny, has good action, and can just be fun. This is going to be some people's least favourite film yet also others will genuinely enjoy it. 
2018-10-05 09:11:18 I would have loved it if they played up Venom being a loser. 

Say he refers to a tater tot as a turd after getting scolded by Brock for eating turds out of the garbage. Then Venom asks for Eddie to heat up some turds (tater tots) and gets a little laugh, but then a big payoff at the end when Venom uses the line. Which could also add to the loser perspective.

I wish they elaborated on Eddie being a loser. 

Say like:
Eddie's journalism was actually a selfie portfolio he attempts to use at a job interview and gets turned down. He steals an actual lead from his GF which gets published without him getting credit and his GF gets fired because of what he did. 


2018-10-05 09:13:09 Two Marvel movies in a row that’s Sony made on their own they spoiled the last scenes in trailers. So fucking dumb. 
2018-10-05 10:15:10 This movie was hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2018-10-05 10:16:02 I hate that this movie did the PG grab.... You can see where it tried to capture the (im)mature 18+ crowd in a way reminiscent of the first Dead Pool, but didn't have the balls to go all in on it. While the story was very bland - I am thinking the alleged 40mins of cut scenes were probably ones that develop the Venom character so when he goes from "Murder all humans" to "I kind of like it here..." doesn't feel like such a flip. Lets be real - Character development in most modern action movies has became this - Characters who outright state their thoughts, rather than showing us development. Ultimately it deserves its place as a middle of the batch -half-baked- "Cash-in the IP before superheros die off" movie.
2018-10-05 18:44:25 It was lame at many points, but I didn't find it insufferable, so I will be patiently waiting for a sequel if this makes its money back.
2018-10-05 20:57:42 I had no expectations, and thought the movie was not all bad, certainly not as bad as the RT score. Read some other comments that say the same. With that said, there were some things I liked: some of the jokes I thought were pretty good, pace of the movie was alright for the last 2/3, the symbiote animation was of cool, and overall the movie didn't take itself too seriously. It kind of reminded me of Sam Raimi Spiderman. I also liked most of the Venom/Eddie interaction, although it took me off guard when I heard the voice. 

Some bad things: Bad to okay writing, unintentional hilarity, horrible villain, and a climax/final fight scene that is just boring and predictable. Venom is clearly shown to be a separate entity, and I wish the script showed more ways that Eddie and Venom needed each other, besides just giving Venom human-like motivations. This movie basically became an odd-couple trope. Overall lots of wasted potential I thought, even keeping the current plot in mind.

I haven't read the comics so I can't speak to how close it is to source material. Bonus Stan Lee cameo was cool, and the trailer and extra scene for Into the Spiderverse were fucking cool. Gonna see that one for sure.
2018-10-06 08:22:48 This movie was a tire fire but it was an enjoyable tire fire and Tom Hardy stole the show so I'll give it a 6/10
2018-10-06 10:14:02 Movie was good. Cgi was a bit weird. As soon as Eddie went to the prison I knew it was something about Carnage. Kinda weird that it's going to be woody Harrelson 
2018-10-06 17:16:42 Its really fun if youbare high or drunk cuz as soon as you think while watching this you wont have much of a time
2018-10-07 00:08:50 I thought by having Venom inside Eddie, Eddie was dying. Did his change somehow?
2018-10-07 08:00:39 I've seen some 30% movies and this most definitely does not belong. It definitely COULD HAVE been a great movie, but way too many plot holes and lazy writing. Could have honestly been fixed with a lot of small changes. Movie was fair, I thought.
2018-10-07 12:11:09 A lot better than I expected. I've only read a few of the comics but to me I felt like writing for the symbiote was on point. I even could buy into the reason as to why Venom would want to team up with Eddie. The action scenes were so-so, the chase scene was kind of long and repetitive and the police scene had so much more potential. Didn't really like the symbiote CGI. The villain wasn't original, but I've seen worse. I think the part that got to me the most was how dumb Eddie was in the movie.
2018-10-08 20:20:47 Something about the voice and its lines felt way too much like transformers to me. 
2018-10-09 13:23:56 Solid 3 out of 5 movie. Enjoyed it, was never bored, nothing in it that I actually disliked except maybe the end-credits song, nothing stood out as especially brilliant either but it all worked. Really does not deserve the way everyone was determined to hate it before it came out.
2018-10-09 19:03:46 Woody Harrelson is Carnage? WTF.
2018-10-14 16:36:54 I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was great 
2018-10-05 20:43:03 Critics blew this out of proportion. It's actually fine and close to the comics version of Venom. A 7/10.
2018-10-05 23:01:11 The movie is amazing and more fun than most of the good movies in recent times. Don't fall for shitty reviews, it has its flaws but not as worst as it's being portrayed. Go watch it. 7.5/10
2018-10-06 11:40:35 This just seems like critics and people bashing it since it wasn't made by marvel and isn't that kind of style...

I mean ant man and the wasp was the shittest writing in marvel history and people like that? I wanted to chew off my nose watching that crap

This film was ace to watch, every marvel film I've seen in the past few years I got bored in more than one part, but this was a fun change. Could have used a tad bit better writing but it wasn't awful, I'd give it a 7/10 


2018-10-06 17:46:45 If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire film. There is not a single surprise left. "The world has enough superheroes"? Apparently not since this venom is 100% a superhero... 1/10
2018-10-05 07:44:46 This was easily one of the worst comic book movies ever,  it’s right up there with Catwoman and Batman and robin
2018-10-17 03:00:02 Jesus lads, That was absolutely terrible in pretty every way. Even Tom Hardy was bad in it. Also that post credits scene was hilariously bad. 
2018-10-05 07:19:43 Generic action movie. Could have been about anything if not for the few Venom scenes. Not a bad movie, but boring and honestly hindered by its PG-13 rating. Came off as wannabe edgy. You can almost hear the 10 year olds who’s parents let them see this talking about how epic this movie is. 

The villain is generic and cliche to a point with a boring middle of road the actor playing him. Imagine Spider-Man 1 Green Goblin minus William Defoe. He went on and on about how “humans are ruining the earth and need to be cleansed” it was super preachy. The audience was only “afraid” of him because the movie LITERALLY told us to be.

The girlfriend character doesn’t act like any rational person would. It’s like the director told her to be a bitch with no understanding about how relationships work. She’s supposedly the one who launches the whole movie off and it isn’t believable.

Venom himself isn’t that bad, but the writers turned him into a joke and it felt like they had a special effects budget of $2. The scenes with him look pretty good, but there’s only like 4 scenes. As far as the jokes go they were actually pretty good, but that’s a problem. There’s a difference between making jokes and him being one. He makes jokes in the comic as well, but here it just reflected poorly on the character.

The music choice was bad and “what’s hip right now with the kids” The most movie-by-committee thing about the movie.

All in all not a bad movie, but a generic action movie that abused the name Venom to sell tickets. “I bet we can sell a lot of tickets if we put Venom in a movie.” I feel like Venom is the victim of assault and robbery for taking his name and putting it on this movie.

The fight choreography using the symbiote was pretty good.

There’s a disappointing mid credit scene that feels like more battery and abuse.

The after credit scene is literally a new scene from Into the Spider-Verse. They had so little faith in this movie that they wrap it up with basically a trailer for their next movie. 
2018-10-05 21:16:52 Going in I was open-minded and prepared for the best or worst. I'm a huge classic Spider-Man comic book fan (before it all went to hell in the '90s). Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite superhero movies. I refuse to watch Homecoming to this day because it ripped out too many core elements of the character. With Venom, I understood that they couldn't repeat Sam Raimi's plot from SM3 and that the Secret Wars angle means no movie can truly be faithful to the comics. I didn't like the early trailers for Venom but later ones grew on me.

Then I saw the movie last night and thought it was a solid B+. Tom Hardy's performance in the dual role simply made the movie. He nailed it. This came off as a truly original character on screen. The weirdness of the symbiote relationship and the murky morality of both Eddie and Venom made it fascinating to watch. The character could go in any direction at any time and wasn't predictable. The characters, both played by Hardy of course, had great chemistry and were even a surprisingly good comedy team at times.

I don't think this would have been better if rated R. Venom is a character from standard, newsstand, code-approved comic books. Too much gore would've taken away from an appropriately comic-booky feel.

And I actually thought the villain was very good too. I liked that he gave a subdued performance instead of ranting and raving. His intellectual arguments for doing what he was doing were well-written. He was also a very effective device to explain everything we needed to know about the symbiotes. And what happened to him later on was cool and effective. Also nice to see an Indian villain in a sci-fi/fantasy movie for a change of pace. Last one I remember was Mola Ram in Temple of Doom.

The weaker elements were the pacing and effects. Everything was almost a little too fast-paced. The action scenes looked very well-designed, but everything moved very fast, making it hard to follow all the action sometimes. They cut out that dialogue from the trailer where Eddie's girlfriend says "you're scaring me right now." It could've used some slower, quieter moments like that in the middle of the movie to build more suspense. And the effects were not done by a top-rate house IMO. Some of the symbiotes in the action scenes just did not look fully rendered. The close-ups in the dialogue scenes looked better.

I didn't really understand where some of the occasional unintentional laughs in the audience were coming from. I noticed some silly stuff in the movie, like how the symbiotes have given themselves cool-sounding English names for some reason. But this was all within the realm of acceptable comic book silliness.

The bonus Spider-Verse scene after the credits just sucked. I would never see that in a million years. Of course it's all based on those horrible 1990s-and-up Spider-Man comics that spit all over the true Spider-Man character by introducing stupid clones and knockoffs of the one, true Spider-Man. But the scene itself was just dumb, absurd, ridiculous, unfunny slapstick. It felt like an insult to the Spider-Man legacy.
2018-10-08 02:15:26 Well.... Just saw it and I think it was pretty bad. I love Hardy, but the rest of the casting was poor. A lot of the choices of the characters were so bad that I cringed a couple of times. 4/10 for me. 
2018-10-05 10:48:05 Yeah, not a fan at all. I honestly couldn't even fathom how bad some aspects were. Almost all acting outside of Tom Hardy were noticeably bad (especially Michelle Williams). The editing was nearly as bad, if not worse, than The Predator somehow. The dialogue was awful and the plot felt so dragged out and undeveloped at the exact same time. The only redeeming factor was the relationship between Eddie and Venom. There was some genuinely hilarious moments in the movie ("pussy" part had me in tears from laughter) and i actually enjoyed the last 20 mins or so after the main plot comes to a close. I almost wish they went full on comedy because those parts were hands down the best. Also, this film being pg-13 hurt it a good amount even though the editing was so bad during the action scenes i don't even know if it would've mattered.

&#x200B;

All in all, i thought it was bad minus the last 20 mins which i thought were fun. Upgrade has a similar plot and is a MUCH better film. 4/10 for me.
2018-10-05 15:48:24 This was dreadful. Such a terrible movie. Choppy, nonsensical, and forced. Nothing about it was true to any of the characters and it entirely wasted the cast.
2018-10-06 08:43:49 Sony: So we're gonna have Tom Hardy make a complete full of himself for nearly 2 hours and have Venom onscreen for maybe 10 minutes.
2018-10-10 00:29:14 So basically it's stupid movie that's boring and stupid for an entire fucking hour, then fun and stupid for half an hour, then "over the top but in a boring and stupid way" for 15 minutes. 

Ok so, it's not the Catwoman level catastrophe some were predicting, but I really don't get all the "it was actually really good!" comments. Is this just more of the it's either utter shit or awesome dichotomy and since it isn't complete shit reddit collectively doesn't know what to do other than say it's actually really good? 


It's like a bad movie with some good elements and fun scenes. But when you get a good movie with some weak elements and a quasi plot hole or two then it's overrated and a piece of shit. 
2018-10-05 16:28:22 I will say only one thing. If this movie belonged to the MCU it wouldnt be rated so low by the critics, neither hating the movie would become a meme. It is by no means an excellent movie, but it doesnt deserve ratings lower than the predator for example. It is a 6/10 fun movie, and the audience scores show that it is a better movie than the critics say, as much as you dont like it. 
2018-10-05 06:45:02 Not going to lie, I actually enjoyed the shit out of this and the more I think about it the more I like it. Is it perfect, hell no. At times it’s completely messy but I’m more than happy to look past some of it because the dynamic between Eddie and Venom was something great. The plot was fine, it’s basic but easy to follow. The secondary characters were bland but served their point as a plot device. The action at times looked great but was a visual blur at others. But the humour was spot on for me. The score was great. Tom Hardy carries this movie which is all I needed considering he is the two main parts.
2018-10-05 06:45:26 This movie showed signs of life (no pun intended).  With a better script, this could've been an awesome movie.  I wish they had kept some of the 40 minutes cut.
2018-10-05 07:59:48 Maybe it's because I don't know much at all about Venom's story (besides the OG Spiderman movies) but I just felt the dialogue was laughably bad? It seems like they tried to make Venom as some silly family friend with crazy antics but I just wasn't feeling it. The vocabulary was so stupid. I put my hand up in "what? really?" motion more than a few times. I'm glad I chose to go to the cheap theater to watch. Worth the $6 and not $15. 

Some things I really liked, some things made me cringe my face. One viewing in a theater was enough.
2018-10-05 08:11:39 Wow the movie has lower ratings than Spider-Man 3... ouch.
2018-10-05 12:09:49 Nah did not like it
2018-10-05 23:48:33 For those needing a super hero point of reference that is actually accurate, this movie is on par with Edward Norton’s Hulk movie, but with a much more interesting main character, better love story, and equally entertaining action sequences
2018-10-08 04:31:59 Can someone explain something to me, because there seems to a gaping plot hole in the movie...So Riz's character and the scientists make a big deal out of how the symbiotes can't survive on our planet, and need viable hosts. Throughout the movie we see several human-symbiote bonds that simply fail, with the humans dying and the symbiote leaving. We also see two of the symbiotes are dead because they couldn't find a host. And this happened in a matter of seconds, mind you.

Now it was my understanding that the reason Venom was able to survive was because he found a suitable host in the form of Eddie Brock. HOWEVER, there are cases in the film where both Venom and Riot are able to survive out in the world with seemingly any host. Riot takes over a random Malaysian lady, then the old woman, then the little girl, and finally Riz's character, but I can buy the idea that he's special since he was said to be like the leader of the Klyntar race. However, how do you explain the fact that Venom is able to bind to a random dog AND to Anne, with seemingly no side effects? Both hosts seem to work just fine.
2018-10-09 00:42:07 This is a really dumb minor thing for me to nitpick about, but does anyone else think it's a really dick move for Eddie's fiance to break off their engagement? Like, he was just trying to do the right thing, then she acts like he intentionally tried to sabotage and ruin her life, and then to top it off she's immediately banging another guy.
2018-10-05 17:12:24 
I loved the shit out of this movie!
2018-10-05 22:57:39 I really liked it, people here made it sound like its top 5 worst movies material, but the second half was great and i was satisfied with it. It was at least more fun than homecoming, i can tell you that.
2018-10-08 00:03:38 I thought this movie was actually really good, I loved Eddie and Venom's relationship and the fight scenes were beyond badass, the only bad thing was the final boss fight, jesus that was bad, other than I loved it
2018-10-16 13:57:50 Best thing about Venom was Michelle Williams' ability to rock that skirt.  
2018-10-05 06:16:48 I really liked it!


Reviews were unfair


I hope I see them again on screen
2018-10-05 06:20:47 I dont care what anyone says, that was a fun movie. Not Avengers quality but solid. 4 out of 5 stars.
2018-10-09 18:03:18 I feel like the only person who absolutely LOVED the film! The end credit scene with Carnage had me fangirling hard.
2018-10-05 17:00:19 I’m not gonna see it simply because Spider-Man is vital to the origin of Venom. This movie doesn’t make sense
2018-10-06 11:32:20 Sorry to say, i think the critics are right about this one. And it's not a MCU bias on my part, either. Otherwise, i wouldn't adore Logan as much as i do. I didn't go in wanting to dog it, but sadly the gaping holes are just WAYYY too noticeable. The first 30-45 minutes was REALLY half-baked, hackneyed and just plain dumb. Here are a couple of points i noted as i watched(and they came in REAL fast, this movie is that badly written):

&#x200B;

 1. Eddie Brock jeopardizes his girlfriend's case by revealing knowledge of the lawsuits to the evil Life guy, making him an irredeemably unlikable AND stupid character. Yet the movie tries to sell him as this hot, totally credible reporter, but he carries himself like a total bro. I don't blame Hardy for this, cause he can play calculating and amiable well. It's just utterly terrible characterization.  
2. The good scientist confides to Eddie what the bad guy does, even though we, the audience, know he can't be trusted to guard information. Also, the good scientist is somehow smart enough to get Eddie into the building, yet dumb enough to forget about the fucking cameras. Then again, the security doesn't even catch that until the next day so.....yay, they're all idiots.  
3. The bad guy is unbelievably stupid. OK sure, maybe his plan to attach humans to symbiotes is morally questionable, but he could have gone about it the smart way and just let the good scientist actually do her thing, and THEN exploit the symbiotes. But no, just start sacrificing humans cause........ evil and shit.  
4. The symbiotes have no real clear agenda other than "take over the Earth". The symbiote that gets loose in Malaysia takes 6 fucking months to get to the bad guy and take him over, without reason. Like, how does he know where to go, and why the bad guy as the host, other than he's the bad guy? Was it somehow eavesdropping in the spaceship over privy information before it crashed? Iunno.  
5. Venom's good "turn"(if you can even call it that) makes absolutely no sense. He says that Eddie is the reason Earth is worth seeing, even though we(and Venom, for that matter) know that he's a fuckup and can't be trusted. Hell, Venom actually has to TELL Eddie to apologize to his ex-girlfriend for fucking her over. It's like the creature from outer space understands basic decency more than this haggard layabout.  
6. Symbiote ass and tits. That is all. 
2018-10-07 08:25:47 After reading all these comments I’m surprised so many people liked this movie. 

What was really good about this movie? Nothing felt original, the dynamic between eddie and his gf felt weird and forced for the plot’s sake. Eddie’s character was thick, the relationship with venom had no explanation. The antagonist was not interesting. Dialogue felt unfinished and cliche. Aliens were captured and one escaped from... jars? The aliens had a squad but one of the squad members was a loser? 

I mean the action scenes were fun but the movie that was built around it was seriously bad i thought. 
2018-10-07 16:35:45 Venom is 100 times better than Ant-Man and the Wasp.
2018-10-05 06:21:37 Way better than that trash of a Predator movie that's for sure
2018-10-05 07:31:26 Ever since I was a kid when Spider-Man 3 released, I’ve wanted a Venom movie. Growing up being a fan of the character and the comics, I can honestly say that even though this movie may not have been perfect, but it was SO much fun and I’ll definitely see it again multiple times. My theater was erupting with laughter at points, and certain people even clapped. I really think the critics are being way too harsh on this movie. Obviously if this movie was made to be part of the MCU it would be better, but for now this is great and seeing my favorite comic book character star in his own movie makes me so happy.
2018-10-06 04:36:01 Not planning to see the movie but does anyone have a picture of Carnage? Heard he looks like a carrot.
2018-10-07 09:45:10 I don't know what movie the critics saw, but this was great. While I would have preferred that Venom had kept his connection to Spiderman as in the comics, everything else in it was exactly what I wanted from a Venom movie. Tom Hardy did an excellent job.  Granted it certainly wasn't a deep or artistic movie, but it kept me entertained from start to finish. 
2018-10-07 23:03:36 Venom is a mediocre movie that I somewhat enjoyed. 

I wouldn’t want another one, tho.

I can’t say I liked anyone except Venom and we don’t even learn that much about him other than he has a good sense of humor, was using Brock, and he’s a loser on Klyntar. 

Ruz Ahmed and Riot are horrible, they aren’t Steppenwolf bad but they suck. The only notable character traits (being real generous with this) they have is Riz’ persuasive charisma and Riot’s cool powers.

Action is flashy and cool, but when we get to the final fight it becomes and incomprehensible mess. The problem with the action is that at no point there’s no emotion, there’s no clash of ideals, it’s all mostly just surface level and unmemorable.

The theme is hard to discern but I think it’s a union only works if both people are in sync, but Ant-Man and The Wasp did a theme on partnerships/unions and that was much better and comprehensible.

Plot is okay, nothing special.

Soundtrack was cool.

Venom is funny, action is entertaining but unmemorable. Soundtrack is cool. That’s the only good things I can say about Venom.

It’s a 5/10 and I was somewhat entertained.

2018-10-05 06:20:17 I don't know why this move got bad reviews. This movie is really good it's dark enough to be a Venom movie but also funny enough to be a Marvel movie. 

Also the after credits scene is ummm it's something that I didn't know I wanted lol.There are some minor plotholes though which one will catch pretty easily. 

Definitely need a Rated R version next time, It worked for Deadpool. 
2018-10-08 05:51:23 This was pretty damn bad. Not suicide squad, but it just reeks of corporate decisions and not a movie made with a vision. Out of curiosity, and not trying to be condescending at all, anyone who likes the movie wanna tell me why? I just felt like the only real positive I hear people talk about was Venom and Eddie’s relationship but tbh it wasn’t well developed at all. The progression of their “relationship” didn’t make sense to me at all.
2018-10-05 06:13:26 I don’t even know what the fuck that was yet I still can’t bring myself to hate it or even love it in a “so bad it’s good” kind of way. 
2018-10-05 06:18:25 One thing I didn't get from the story was that Drake was having problems with the symbiote because they couldn't find the right host. They compared it to an organ transplant, which was why the symbiotes kept killing the test subjects.

But Venom went back and forth from Eddie to Anne to Eddie with no problem. Same for Riot, went from person to person until it got to Drake.
2018-10-05 06:54:51 Tom hardy tries to act his way through a Sony movie. The R rating wouldn’t have mattered, the best parts and potential of the character/casting was the lighter hearted banter between Eddie & venom. It was just surrounded by a hilariously bad movie.
2018-10-05 09:02:50 I feel like Im the only one that thought this movie was awful going through these comments. I gave it a 2/10. The acting was just god awful. The cinematography was bland. Venom looked like a black jackolantern slug with white vains. 

Honestly, it reminded me a lot of the 90s Spawn film. I even found that movie better than this. 
2018-10-05 09:53:08 I had a good time. It was probably the best, bad movie I’ve ever seen.
2018-10-05 11:35:40 Did Eddie Brock just randomly know that woman in the containment cell at the Life Foundation, or was she introduced previously?
2018-10-06 01:01:26 You know that saying people have where they tell you to have low expectations so you aren't disappointed? That's what this movie felt like. I lurk on this sub a bit and the comments about the trailers shitting on it so bad I was wondering why I was going to see it but I'm glad I did.  
  
It's a 4ish/10 movie and I expected 2/10. People are shitting on Eddie Brock's character but no one else could have done it like Hardy does. He was certainly bland and something about Hardy makes it hard to buy he's the reporter type and that's what takes the movie down a few notches. BUT the scenes where Hardy and Venom have dialogue together are great. Dark, tasteless humor and bad jokes are exactly what I'd think Venom would have. It doesn't nail the hero/comedy line that Deadpool does so well, but it certainly participates in its own way. 
2018-10-06 06:12:04 I loved it.
2018-10-06 07:45:28 The first half was probably the most cliched half of a film I've ever seen; same hero story, at once all the events unfold (like sure, *of course* you would get fired from your job, have your career ended and engagement plans demolished all in the span of 24 hours because why not), same bad guy, evil organization etc etc. But the second half was better than I thought! Loved the action scenes, the humor between Venom and Brock was forced but enjoyable, and I would have loved to watch another hour of Venom/Brock doing dumb shit like eating out of a garbage can, interacting with neighbors etc. I'd give it a solid 75, not something I'd watch again but I sure had a good time while I was there.
2018-10-06 09:32:32 4 out of 10
2018-10-07 21:09:34 Wow I feel like I saw the whole movie already thanks to the trailers (way to go Sony marketing team) the only the things that weren’t in it were Eddie being a complete animal in his apartment and the restaurant and the forest scene with she venom, everything I had seen already. At least the ticket was only $8 and the food was good I guess
2018-10-08 09:05:54 I don’t know if it’s because the negative reviews made me go in with the notion that it was terrible, but I actually liked it. I like the symbiote/Eddie dialog...it was life of like they were a one man buddy cop movie

The second post credit scene...that was a mess. It had no business being there. It was basically just a commercial for a cartoon. 
2018-10-09 06:35:56 I want to see more of this Venom. Sadly, I have a feeling that isn't going to happen and that fucking sucks.
2018-10-05 06:06:44 I watched Venom (2018). I think it is pretty Mediocre and I would gave it 5 out of 10, the last time I felt like this when I was watching the predator (2018).

The first act is pretty dull and it feels like chore. In my opinion it failed to gave me a reason why Eddie Brock is compelling.

When he did the symbiosis with Venom, things got little bit better but not much. The CGI for me felt really spotty in final fight., this wouldn't be a problem if the movie excels on characterization, script, or acting. But I admit there is a good dynamic between Eddie and Venom, feels like they could explore that more in the movie.

Some of the scenes are very funny but I am not sure if it is intentional or not. Nevertheless, some of them are still entertaining.

Overall, I think the movie is mediocre. I think I will forget most parts of the movie in a few days.

The Best Part for me was the post-credit scene, which is a sneek peek to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It is really excellent.

P.S. 

I would not recommend this to the people who are on the fence to watch this movie and has limited resources like time or money. I said that because this October has more promising movies like:

* A First Man
* Halloween
* A Star Is Born
* Bad Times at El Royale
* The Oath
* The Hate U Gave


Venom for me feels like waste of those resources. 
2018-10-05 06:12:35 Great movie, enjoyed the relationship with the symbiote, and found the humour well placed.

Glad this won't be going to the MCU anytime soon to be completely ruined. Can't wait for Carnage. 
2018-10-05 06:48:42 I fucking had a blast with this movie. Sure, I would’ve liked to see Spider-Man in it. Sure, I would’ve liked it to be R. But this is the Venom we got and damn does he look good!  

IT BETTER GET A SEQUEL BECAUSE THAT MID CREDITS SCENE HAD ME HYPPPPPEEE
2018-10-05 07:33:47 A fun movie, a lot better than a few recent formulaic Marvel movies for sure. I.e Ant Man 2. Which wasn’t a bad movie just boring. The start was a bit all all over the place, editing wise.  But it has some great action sequences and humour. Loved the Eddie and Venom dynamic. Ending battle was a bit disappointing, too much shaky cam and fast editing. These stupid reviews savaging the movie are so harmful because it’s not that bad at all.
2018-10-05 09:29:09 What a fucking infantile 14 year old idea of a good movie. It was a hot mess that made no sense and was just nonsensical chaos. 
2018-10-07 01:42:39 I didn't hate it but it feels like it's straight from 1998. Boring as hell. The villain is terrible. Tom Hardy is likable as Eddie and his relationship with Venom is obviously the best part. The whole thing is choreographed from the word go so just don't expect it to be anything different in your brain. And god damn that wig on Woody. 

5/10
2018-10-05 06:13:03 This movie was so awful and I loved every second of it


Prob the most I've laughed at a movie all year tbh
2018-10-05 06:26:26 Fuck it I liked it, it was way better than any of the fantastic four movies, Daredevil, Catwoman or shit like The Meg. Really wouldn't mind seeing another Venom if they can keep the fun cheesiness.
2018-10-07 00:00:13 You knew it was going to be shit right from the horrible cgi space and spaceship scene.  Every fight scene had a billion camera angle cuts. One or two cool slow mo movements in the last fight 
2018-10-06 09:50:29 This is shit, and it’s kind of depressing to see so many on here defend this shit because it means we are going to get more of this shit. The plotting and basic filmmaking ability (like shot-reverse shots that arent disorientating) are beyond shit, yet still a bunch of people lap it up and blame the critics. 
2018-10-06 07:27:04 I have no clue why critics are giving it that bad of a score. They are way off. Comes off kind of elitist. Venom wasn’t a perfect movie but it definitely was above average and a fun movie. Some scenes dragged but overall the venom character was awesome, Tom hardy was great. Hope we get a sequel. 
2018-10-07 15:46:15 Bruh these comments are either bought or these guys are just really dumb. This movie was a steaming pile of horse poop
2018-10-05 06:04:46 Not even three time Oscar winner Dan Lewis could make this film worth watching
2018-10-05 20:57:34 Just got out of the 1030 showing.  This movie was dope.  I couldn't disagree with the critics more.  I don't even think it needed to be R.  I read some critics saying how they didn't know if some scenes we're intentionally meant to be funny. Uh it's obvious yes they were.  Did they not here the back and forth between Venom and Eddie.  

I hope people aren't put off by the low critic score and make up their minds for themselves.  Very entertaining and I am pumped for the sequel if there is one.
2018-10-07 00:48:28 Why on Earth did Anne refer to Venom's weakness as his kryptonite? They shouldn't have that phrase because Superman doesn't exist in the Marvel universe.
2018-10-05 06:15:09 Not MCU levels of quality but in a world where the DCEU is a thing this movie is not bad. It was a fun ride, it went by fast and I got to see Venom on the big screen. 
2018-10-05 07:09:19 I’ve been disappointed by everything I’ve seen of this film in trailers. Then the reviews... I have wanted the DC films to succeed and I hated JL and was meh on BvS. That said, I loved Venom. I will see it again. The world Venom inhabits is the biggest issue with the film. It’s shallow and not very intriguing. Venom and Brock are a hilarious dynamic and I frankly just want to see more of this character and especially Carnage. I really hope Sony doesn’t abort another project at launch. 
2018-10-05 07:29:28 It's funny that I'm not seeing this movie, but was looking forward to this comment section for the past month.
2018-10-05 08:56:05 Woody Harrelson looked like a poor man's carrot top. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely we'll ever actually even see his Carnage. 
2018-10-05 09:55:42 I was expecting to think it would be a waste of money to watch but this movie is actually good! Venom sounds so close to the venom from the Ultimate Spider-Man game. It really sucks that it doesn’t involve Spider-Man whatsoever. I think that’s what hold it back a little. Spidey is my favorite hero so seeing one of his most iconic villains get another chance at the big screen was amazing for me so I guess I was a little biased for enjoying it. Personally I give it a 7/10. 
2018-10-06 13:26:09 This was a bad movie. Some parts were fine but its mostly schlock that doesn’t embrace the fact that its schlock.

A lot of the dialogue was was just not good and poorly written, some of the effects looked *super* low-budget (specifically the Venom/Brock sort of splicing that happens in the MRI room) and that motorcycle chase scene was so dumb and way too long.

For me, it was enjoyable in the sense that you can sort of laugh *at* it a lot of the time as well as with it a handful of others.
2018-10-08 08:54:14 Honestly, I loved it. What a fun ride. Most of why it works is because of Tom Hardy, but boy did they use his acting style well. The body contortion moments were awesome, and all the little character building scenes (convenience store robbery, noisy neighbour) felt relatable and authentic. The relationships were all well written (Eddie/Anne/Dan/Venom).

And that post-credits scene. Holy shit. I just hope they improve the symbiote on symbiote action, the Venom vs Riot fight should've been a standout but it just ended up being a messy CGI clusterfuck. Shame too, it had great ideas like the symbiotes tearing apart leaving Eddie to fight Carlton, but the execution was lacking. For a movie that spends so much time talking about biting people's heads off, I was very disappointed in how weak it looked, even for PG13 standards. I've seen gorier things on CW's Supernatural. 
2018-10-08 14:15:25 Who makes the Poll questions?  Poor attempt at comedy.
2018-10-09 01:48:21 I really liked it. Damn me.

They mention Jamison! BUT Brock acted like aliens are far out. So that's confusing. There are aliens in the MCU, and Spider-man is in the MCU now. So WTF?

There should've been corpses everywhere in the launch room. Looked like Riot just turned over some tables. That was weird. They missed out on an opportunity for black comedy when Anne entered the aftermath.

Riz is a wonderful sociopath. Reminds me of Eisenberg's Luthor. But we like him.

Slate is really cute. She banged Chris Evans. Good for them.

Woody is older than I imagine CK. Not that he nailed down the creep factor.
2018-10-05 07:44:41 This movie was awesome! Fuck the critics!
2018-10-05 11:56:18 Way, way better than I expected. A pretty fun movie and a really solid adaption of Venom himself. 
2018-10-05 07:27:42 I do not understand any of this negative reception.

I thought this was a great Venom movie! Not only did I get so much more Venom than I thought I would, as a character, Venom himself was perfect! His voice, his desire to eat, his distinction from the other Symbiotes. It was better than I ever thought it would be. And I love that the movie itself leans more towards horror when exploring the symbiotes. A lot of this film feels horrific and made me feel a bit worrisome; I had no clue what to expect since the tone never felt “safe”, while still feeling exciting.

I felt the writing was pretty damn good. It’s a balanced film with characters that have clearly displayed motivations, and I loved that they were more-so shown to the audience, rather than spoken or ‘exposited’ in a more predictable way. The acting is top-notch. Nothing stood out to me as bad character writing or poor performance. The villain fees like a guy that truly believes his erratic and insane philosophies, and simultaneously feels brilliant and dangerous. Michelle Williams character was god for the most part. She is probably the more forgettable character of the main cast, but she never felt bad in any eye-rolling way either.

I love that Eddie Brock struggles a lot in this film. The movie takes plenty of time to show his self-confidence and identity issues. His struggle felt clear and sad, while also remaining hopeful due to his unwillingness to give up. I love that the movie shows his lack of bravery and cowardice with the corner-store scenes. It makes the connection with Venom all the better, as they Mirror each other nearly perfectly. Where Eddie is hesitant and worrisome, Venom is ambitious, fearless, and overly confident. They clearly complete one another.

I am still floored by how well-developed and well-written this movie is. I just don’t see how anyone could make a better standalone Venom movie than this! It never felt undercooked, or shallow, or chopped up in any noticeable way, or that it suffered studio interference, the way Amazing Spider-Man 2 did. 

I seriously do not understand any of the criticisms others have. I just don’t see where people are finding anything to hate here. Is it the best hero film ever? Nah, but it’s leagues beyond the worst. I feel like it’s a bandwagoning effect, or people parroting each other just for the sake of it. I have no idea what these people were expecting, but I walked in with no expectations, and walked out so immensely happy with what I got. 

8/10. Best Sony-led film in a long time, and best Sony superhero film ever. Will own, will see again. 
2018-10-08 07:22:09 I honestly did not even know it was possible for a movie to be this bad.
2018-10-05 06:17:56 Just watched it and I really liked it. Unless something magical happens it might be the best thing we get. Leaps and bounds better than Spider-Man 3. 
2018-10-05 06:23:51 I actually had a decently fun time with this one. 
2018-10-06 09:49:32 Gonna be honest, this film sucked. Did I enjoy it a little bit? Yeah. It was entertaining, but my god it was stupid. So many plot holes, HORRIBLE pacing, it suffers from a serious identity crisis, etc. There was no chemistry between Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams, and Eddy Brock has a lot of weird characterization. The fact that Spiderman isn't around to ground him really hurts the film. Did I find a tiny ounce of it entertaining? Yes. Is the film a turd in the wind? Hell yes. 
2018-10-07 12:24:37 Pretty generic and forgettable movie. Some reviews made it sound like it's the worst movie ever. Generic and uninspiring action scenes with messy CGI symbiote fight. I kind of liked Eddie and Venom interactions I guess. Rest of cast generic and forgettable.   
Edit: Even the credits were really generic, long and boring. I just saw huge walls of text with generic sound track. Like I don't remember other movies with 3 columns of names going on forever.

2018-10-11 19:29:04 Why does everyone keep saying that the movie should have been R-rated?

Venom was a Spiderman villain. One of the more wholesome comic series out there. Not even remotely gritty.

Not to mention the original Venom/Eddie Brock was not some killer. He really only hated Spiderman. There are multiple mentions about him non harming innocents. I recall one scene where there was a runaway horse carriage caused by one of their fights and Spiderman. A girl was about to be trampled, and Spiderman was too woozy to save her and Venom does. And spiderman asks why he saved her. He says, he only wants Peter to die.

Now if it was a Carnage movie, I could understand. But Venom isn't really a "must be R rated" guy.
2018-10-06 11:52:24 Really enjoyed the movie. The crowd was sold out and clapped 3 times during the movie. Had a great time. 8.5/10 for me
2018-10-06 13:47:54 This movie feels like it’s gonna be the new edgy thing for trashy people to quote. “You’re a loser like me” seems like it’s gonna be plastered on a t-shirt so some dude can wear it to a Burger King instead of his old Joker tee. 

In terms of the movie, it felt like bad writing with bad acting and mediocre CGI. 

Riot was barely developed
The final fight scene did nothing unique.
Hardy has been better. 
Pacing felt off. 
Seemed like the checked off must-haves on a clipboard. 

Hour of bad exposition ✔️
Motorcycle car chase (We see you Ducati) ✔️
Main character kisses girl just before climax ✔️
Explosion-filled fight ✔️
Cheeky end scene w/ girl hinting relationship ✔️

Overall 6/10, because that Ducati Scrambler was pretty slick.
2018-10-07 19:54:23 Not gonna lie the best part of the movie was just the end credit scene
Edit:I meant the spider verse end credit scene but the Carnage tease was also pretty good
2018-10-08 16:36:07 I'm conflicted on seeing this movie. One one hand, I don't want to give Sony money to use in their "Spider-Verse" (or other awful Sony ideas) and on the other hand, the movie is already quite successful, so my ticket wouldn't make a change going forward.

I've never purposefully gone to a to see a bad movie, but I really want to be part of the discussion.

I'm checking my theaters- if I find a showing for less than 5 bucks I'm going. 
2018-10-09 15:45:38 i think we should be comparing **Venom** (2018) to **Iron Man** (2008) and **Man of Steel** (2013), because these films were all the opening features in each of their respective cinematic universes - their success determine/d the prospects of their proposed universes

most people would agree that Iron Man is still the best of the three, and Man of Steel is still the worst...Venom comes in somewhere in the middle

while it is quite a bit weaker than Iron Man on some measures like plot, i would suggest that Venom is probably not that far off Iron Man overall as an opening gambit of a cinematic universe franchise...Iron Man gets over-sentimentalised a lot...it was actually just as orthodox and formulaic in its setup as Venom

the bottom line is that general audiences are having fun watching Venom and are now quite interested in his next steps, and enthusiastic about the possibilities for Sony's Spiderverse: Venom is doing its job about as well as Iron Man did its job, which is getting audiences interested in seeing more

while i enjoyed Zod and Zimmer, as soon as i saw Man of Steel i knew that DC had fucked their whole universe completely...Sony have definitely learned from Marvel and DC's examples


2018-10-05 11:21:04 I enjoyed this a lot more than Antman & The Wasp which has an 88 RT score.


Tom Hardy was having a ball which was entertaining enough. 
The budget constraint was quite apparent though,proper Venom scenes werent as many as I wanted.
2018-10-05 09:27:33 Just came out of the cinema hall. Well, I loved the movie. I wouldn't say it was bad but I can't say it was great either. Though I wouldn't rate it as low as people have rated it. The plot is good as they've tried to show who venom is or how he came to be(for the people who haven't read the comics). Riot's role was pretty short though,we knew who he was but for most of the part they've shown him as an unknown symbiote. The CGI wasn't bad, but it could've been better. Venom's fight scenes were really good. A few minor mistakes, but overall a good movie. I'd rate it 6.8/10

Edit : After reading most of the comments below, it seems people are trying to find a deeper meaning to the movie. They're expecting it to be dark. For those who haven't watched it yet, don't look into it too much, keep your brains aside and watch it, just enjoy the movie the way it is. Cheers. 
2018-10-06 04:15:29 This movie was BAD BAD BAD.

I cant get over how bad Venom was and that I wasted money on that. The theater seemed so disappointed in the end. I know many people complain about how kiddy many Marvel movies are (GOTG in particular) but this was the worst case of that to date. It almost feels like a child wrote the script its so so bad!!! 

Michelle Williams feels miscast throughout most of the film, the script is bad, so bad that not even she could save it. Hardy was terrible and his line delivery was awful, the villain did not feel menacing at all and actually was pretty lame, and the CGI was bad throughout, especially the final battle which lasted like 6 minutes. The pacing was awful, the never ending one liners were bad (especially from Venom himself)... the dialogue between Eddie and Venom was ridiculous. 

Guys, its BAD.

I am not shocked to see people here defending it though... pretty typical when it comes to Marvel films (yet they will trash anything DC does when this was worse than them all).
2018-10-08 01:16:41 Im still trying wrap my head around how high people are rating this movie, i understand audience is def. bias especially toward funny comic book movies, but this movie was so bad. The pacing was awful, the casting was probably the worst part with some terrible choices to play characters, the plot holes and decisions were bad, obviously not spiderman and being pg 13 didnt help. The list goes on, id give it a 3/10 with my only really funny part was the lunch and lobster scene
2018-10-06 14:33:50 I mean because this movie got so much shit on it before it came out, people are just rebelling and want to say it was good. Judge the movie for what it was and no outside influences and you realise it was a pretty terrible movie.
2018-10-12 10:26:45 I didn't think a film could top Wonder Woman and take its place as the pinnacle of mediocrity but here we are
2018-10-10 04:13:27 This movie is a dumpster fire in all sense of the phrase. It's hot garbage but it kept me warm sometimes. 

Everything I liked about this movie was done poorly. I really liked a lot of Eddie and the Symbiote's interactions but just as many of them made me think "Why even write that, let alone allow it to make it into the final script?" I loved seeing Venom in all his comic book glory duking it out on screen but then again I couldn't really see shit! Everything is dark and the sequences are typical boring action movie shit barring a few interesting shots only possible in a movie based on a goopy shapeshifting alien. I enjoyed some scenes of some characters including the sociopathic, manipulative villain but not a single person seemed like actual believable people or were fleshed out in any way.

The absolute worst thing about this movie, however, is the pacing. Holy shit. I don't see nearly enough people reaming this movie for this. Screentime was wasted on shit that had zero consiquence on the plot (all of the scenes showing the Riot symbiote getting to Riz), character's change with absolutely no buildup (oh, damn Eddie I like this planet now) and pretty much everything felt rushed as if they just started filming with only a rudimentary plot layed out.

This movie is as bad as Suicide Squad for me but this time I *knew* it would be so when I was dragged to go see it I just went in looking for some good in it rather than being surprised by all the bad.
2018-10-05 06:17:25 Those guards that were chasing Eddy in the woods are faster than the symbiotes themselves. 
2018-10-05 06:32:07 I didn't have high expectations for this movie. It turned out to be better than I was expecting, but it's still far from great.

It's fun. The action is good, the effects are mostly decent, and Tom Hardy was really good as Eddie Brock.

Everyone around Eddie left a lot to be desired. The dialogue was pretty awful between most characters, except for Eddie and Venom. And even then, only about 75% of their dialogue is good. There's some cheesy jokes that probably won't be funny again on a second viewing.

Overall, 5.5/10. You'll have a good time watching it. If it does well enough for the sequel they teased, and that sequel does well enough for a trilogy, it would be cool to see Spiderman, but that's wishful thinking. 
2018-10-05 08:25:24 Was there a Tom Holland cameo?
2018-10-05 09:11:39 I thought this movie so convenient. 
It was convenient that Life was able to contain the symbiote. 
It was convenient that Dan was a surgeon. 
It was convenient at the end where Anne had the time to go from the woods to the lab with a 4K view of the final fight. She also was told how to beat venom in a drive. 5 of 10. Decent fights scenes at least and CGI. 
2018-10-05 09:39:08 I know it keeps being said but honestly this WAS more entertaining than i expected i was expecting to come out of the movie mad at how bad it was but ok, sucks this movie is just there now
2018-10-05 20:42:09 Did anyone catch ANY MCU references?

Even when they are on their date, she said he worked at the “Daily Global” and not Bugle. Which I thought was odd and they could’ve shoe horned in at least some Spider-Man references. 


I also thought they would show Spider-Man footage in the background or one of his contact be JJ Jameson


Overall solid movie. Didn’t deserve the 30%. Hardy plays well with himself and I could watch a whole movie of just that. 
2018-10-06 07:43:58 If this turns successful and you're Tom Hardy what would you do? I'm thinking if I were him and I try to make Sony get new writers for the film and make sure the script is done before anyone walks on set. Also I would request no last minute studio changes, this crap needs to stop.
2018-10-06 08:26:24 I enjoyed the hell out of this movie!

https://youtu.be/31_lAYQiclU
2018-10-06 09:04:56 Call me crazy. I went in totally expecting to hate it, and I actually really enjoyed it. Seriously stunned to be typing that. 3.5/5
2018-10-06 09:25:33 So now Venom as well as Iron Man are Green Lantern.
2018-10-06 11:52:50 The film got a B+ on cinemascores
2018-10-07 02:13:01 masstagger is lighting the fuck up in this thread on people who like this movie and i just think the overlap is funny.
2018-10-08 07:33:08 I have mixed opinions about Venom. The parts that work, work really well, but the parts that don't work fail spectacularly. I wouldn't say that any of the action scenes in Venom are good, and most of the performances are bad. The only thing holding Venom together (for me, at least) was Hardy. He was really charismatic and was the shining point for the film
2018-10-08 10:13:45 I liked it
2018-10-08 22:48:30 most importantly for me, nothing in the film precludes the possibility that Brock/Venom could exist in the same universe as Tom Holland's Peter Parker...when the deal to lend Spider-Man to the MCU is up, i suspect they will pull Spider-Man out of the MCU and drop him in to this Sony Spiderverse...and with casting like Holland and Hardy, i'm down with it
2018-10-09 01:50:39 This movie would be so good if it was 18+
2018-10-11 21:29:17 I liked 2/3rds of it. It was far from perfect but when Venom appears on screen the movie just becomes murky CGI and poorly staged fights.
2018-10-12 00:57:21 Almost as boring as the Amazing Spider-Man films. Tom Hardy is only OK thing about this. One note villain, CGI heavy action scenes you have seen before, bad pace, dull writing and bad soundtrack drags this down to sleep inducing level.  
2018-11-27 17:13:09 There is a explanation for why Venom looks like spiderman in this movie?
2018-10-06 23:02:45 Wasn't bad at all, pissy critics. Good flick to watch with the boys

edit: Though the dialogue was very bad and his ex girlfriend was a bizarre character and there were lots of absurd scenes and it didn't make much sense as a whole and was actually kind of a garbage story but the dialogue between Eddie and Venom was good.
2018-10-05 08:38:26 Did anyone watch this in IMAX? I have money to blow and feel like watching this in IMAX but would love to hear from anyone who's already done so.
2018-10-05 08:48:55 Nah
2018-10-05 21:19:32 Definitely not as bad as critics make it out to be but they completely wasted Tom Hardy acting ability for cheap laughs. This isn't the MCU we didn't need comedic relief after every action sequence.
2018-10-06 20:09:15 Did anyone else take notice to the extras? One scene had me in stitches and another left me so confused. 

There's one scene near the end where evil Elon Musk decides to go man the rocket himself. When told he cant do it alone, he replies "Im not alone" or something stupid like that with a stupid smirk. Anyway, after he says that, the extra behind him raises an open hand to his mouth like what he just heard was the most profound thing ever. My brother leaned over to me and said " 'ohhh I wonder if hes gonna choose me'". Its hilarious. 

The scene that left me confused was the last one. Throughout the movie, I was kinda paranoid about the extras. I really dont know what it was but I felt like any one of them could be following Eddie. And then in the end, where Venom and Eddie are talking about good and bad people and what they look like, I feel like the movie slaps me in the face with my paranoia. I swear there are two female extras in that scene. Eddie is walking down the sidewalk, it seems like the women are talking to eachother, but shortly after they stop to turn and stare at him. And theres another extra thats looking at Eddie and Im pretty sure his eyes do that symbiote thing. It kinda felt like "They Live" (1988). Maybe Im crazy.
2018-10-08 01:03:59 The best line of the movie was definitely the "pile of bodies, pile of hands" bit. Gave a great llamas with hats vibe
2018-10-08 09:43:11 This movie was bad, yet fine and had the ridiculous parts in all the right places.   

It also had an Eminem song, a very on the nose Golden State Warriors Tshirt, and Mac Dre playing. Also, a composer who took nods from the MCU during plot moments, but was very generic and background otherwise.

They completely took the correct route in going for humor rather than being too serious, though, that's really Paker's thing.
2018-10-11 18:06:34 they should have just let hardy/eddie brock be british in this film. the accent and mannerisms screamed "this is what i think a new yorker sounds like", took me out of the film (also, he sounds like he's whimpering in most of his lines).

i also dont entirely like making venom the straight goofy good guy/hero (he works as an antihero/wildcard more), but with no spiderman, looks like thats what were getting. but please give woody a better wig for the sequel
2018-10-08 23:34:57 The fact this movie is being trashed proves critics just hate when movies try anything different 


Fun movie 
2018-10-06 03:58:15 The few minutes of Into The Spider-verse at the end was worth waiting through this whole movie for. 

2018-10-05 06:22:03 This film was unremarkable and forgettable, I probably won't remember that I saw it in a week. There was nothing overtly bad about movie or anything spectacular about it either. The movie Just is a thing. That being said, I think General audiences are going to love this film, because there's nothing to hate about it and Venom is entertaining I think it's a lot of laughs out of everybody. Making this film PG-13 might turn out to to be a good idea, because I could see the character Venom sitting in nicely with Spider-Man over in the Marvel Universe.


That's all I have to say about Venom, this film could've been way better but it also could have been a fuckton worse.

Upgraded did this film better, watch that film instead of this.




So, there are two end credit scenes, the first is comically bad, but the second one is orgasm inducing. The second stinger is at the very end of the credits and is like 5 mins of Into the spider verse and oh my God... the animations so damn good. I can't wait for that film.

Edit:word
2018-10-06 17:35:16 That was terrible but I laughed at it so much that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. The movie was really fucking boring until Venom and Eddie merge though. It's probably the worst superhero movie I have seen since X men Apocalypse but at the same time it was more entertaining than 70% of all the superhero movies I have seen. Hell, I would even say it was more entertaining than any superhero film this year except for Black Panther.
2018-10-10 08:10:53 Mediocre film at best.  But then again, I knew it would be.  Luckily I got a free ticket and didn't have to wait until redbox.  The dialogue was terrible.  The motivations of the characters were nonsensical.  

Eddie is a celebrated investigative journalist and he thinks using confidential information that could have only possibly be discovered through the law firm his fiance is working at was a good idea to bring up?  Ok.  

The final fight started ok and devolved in a giant messy glob.  

So many unanswered and unexplained events just thrown in as well. 

As I’ve seen some people here say upgrade did this movie way better. 


2018-10-05 07:26:53 me during the chase scene: "WHY EXPLODING DRONES!Fuck that was a cool shot. WHY ARE THERE EXPLODING DRONES!"
2018-10-05 20:56:50 The end credits sequence with the Eminem song is now officially my favorite credits sequence of any movie. 
2018-10-07 03:14:29 I don't dislike the movie. But I give it a 5/10.
2018-10-08 06:38:50 I quite liked and enjoyed the film despite it's flaws and differences from Venom's comic book origins. Hardy absolutely owns as Venom and has made the character his own. It felt like taking the rating down to a PG-13 from the intended and originally shot R probably hurt it a fair bit, and I hope we get to see the R-rated cut with the more graphic material re-edited. Despite Marvel saying the film has nothing to do with the MCU I'm hoping they decide to have it exist as something of an offshoot as I definitely am all for Hardy's Venom being part of the MCU.

Loved the mid-credits scene, too. After Natural Born Killers you won't even question Woody Harrelson's ability to portray a complete maniac like Cletus/Carnage, and he's perfectly casted. Can't wait to see his Carnage in action.
2018-10-09 05:21:42 [deleted]
2018-10-05 08:19:58 Anyone else get a serious marvel vibe to it? Movie quality overall felt like it was iron man 1 or 2 but the style felt very similar to a modern marvel film, for better or for worse. 
2018-10-07 00:59:42 Once it got going it wasn't bad. I generally liked it.



It did feel like an early 00's comic movie in regards to odd writing choices and dialog that could have been cut.


Michelle Williams is a terrible actress. 



The turd in the wind joke actually worked. The trailer version got alot of grief but where it takes place and the tone at that point it actually worked. 
2018-10-07 10:43:59 It's a 3/10 only made a 5/10 because of Tom Hardy.  Nothing else about this movie is any good.
2018-10-05 06:51:19 Well.  That was certainly a movie that was **terribly** awesome. Emphasis on the terrible.

Entertaining at most, terrible at best though.
2018-10-06 05:37:43 "still better than anything DC has put out" 
2018-10-06 06:00:18 [deleted]
2018-10-05 07:01:46 Can someone who has seen the movie tell me: is there any attempt to connect this film to any other Marvel properties? 

Does Spiderman exist in this universe? Do any superheroes? 
2018-10-05 08:56:24 Missed the after credits :( was it worth it?
2018-10-05 10:30:25 So, is the 3D in this thing passable or not? I don’t have a lot of hope for a good health score with a movie that seems to be black goop moving around at night.

2018-10-15 00:21:47 Hmm—I believe so, yes. Or some close approximation of that
2018-10-16 01:16:43 Why did Riot kill the one scientist guy when he was getting to the space launch? There was something on the screen I couldn't read quick enough
2018-11-21 17:04:52 I enjoyed it. It’ll be interesting to see how Woody Allen portrays Carnage. Disappointed in the second credits scene.
2018-11-28 21:57:24 I thought it was enjoyable, I laughed a lot and I liked the action scenes.
2018-11-29 08:13:15 A solid 3/5 for me. Good acting, the vision was there, it was comical; alas it was missing some plot points, they seemed to skip over a few things quickly. I'd like a bit more explanation of the symbiotes and their relationship with one another. I'll buy this when it's on sale if the special features are good, I'm curious about what they cut out. 
2018-10-07 09:26:40 I absolutely fucking *loved* this movie. I brought a bunch of people with me and we all enjoyed it, which is funny because we all thought it'd be trash due to the critics shitting on it just like they did to The Greatest Showman, but of course they were wrong. I also didn't have good thoughts about it because I always assumed Villain characters having a solo movie would never go right, especially since I hated Suicide Squad so much, but BOY, I was wrong.

Let me start off by stating that the casting was wonderful. I never cared for Tom Hardy but I loved him in this film, Michelle Williams was spectacular too. I didn't even recognize Jenny Slate that's how well everyone transformed into their roles, it didn't feel like some cheesy comic film, it felt more than that. Michelle Williams and Tom Hardy have wonderful chemistry too. 

The humor was ridiculously spot-on and incredibly enjoyable especially for a villain like Venom, it was as great as the humor in Thor Ragnarok. I loved how the director also strongly incorporated San Francisco the city in the shots, so you actually *felt* like you were there with the character, if that makes sense? - I enjoyed the night shots. This is what Sam Raimi did with the Spiderman films, he heavily focused on the environment Peter Parker was in, which a lot of these directors have a tendency to forget while making comic book films into adaptions.

I also really liked how they made Eddie so intertwined with Venom, I assumed it'd be an all-about destruction time of film since well, Venom is a villain, but it was perfect. The anti-villain is what I thoroughly love.

It was a well done movie, the critics are just being assholes and the Marvel fans don't want to give in, despite it actually being a well-done film because people want Spiderman apart of this, which I get makes sense. I felt the pacing was so quick though for some reason, like I actually was dying to see more. I liked it more than a few recent Marvel films also.

I give the film a solid 8/10. Everyone did a very good job - I wasn't really a fan of Riz though, his performance was slightly weak. Other than that, everything was a *fun* wild night. This is definitely a *must* see, especially on a Friday, you will laugh and you will enjoy yourself and you will be in awe by the characters also. Go see it, it's one of those films where YOU need to be the judge. I loved it.


2018-10-08 07:04:54 Tom Hardy usually picks good roles, too bad this movie is apparently bad. 
2018-10-05 12:49:41 I went into the movie without much expectation with a few friends and was then really surprised. The movie has everything you could wish for and is surprisingly tough for its age rating. Venom & Eddie are a great team and the conversations lead by them are comedy gold. Wonderful fighting scenes and graded CGI make the movie almost perfect for me. I really hope he makes his money so we get a second part.
2018-10-07 12:43:15 I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. Just shows agains that critics don't know what they are talking about. 
2018-10-06 05:35:31 I really really went into this with such low expectations I could have seen suicide squad and been entertained. I was still dissappointed. Wow. 
2018-10-05 06:05:07 /u/Nascarfreak123 on the idea of a Venom Sequel: "I don't compare myself with anybody," Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo with the phrase "I wouldn't mind a Venom Sequel". "I'll let you interpret that however you want," /u/Nascarfreak123 said.

7/10, flawed (lots of cringy dialogue and the story is not the best and original), but it was weird, fun, and entertaining. 
2018-11-03 19:43:49 At the last part where that guy said "When Im released there will be carnage", I think it is a teaser. Carnage is the name of another symbiote, the red & black one. Maybe there will be a part two following this...
2018-10-06 06:00:04 Solid movie. Seems like critics these days just shit on everything for not being a dumb quippy MCU clone.
2018-10-05 06:18:02 I liked it, was expecting way worse. The plot could have been better, bit of plot holes towards the end but i heard quiet a bit of the movie got cut. Sony did right with Venom, liked this Venom way more than Spiderman 3 version, cant wait to see where the go with it. 
2018-10-07 08:21:41 Great action scenes, and Venom is written as chaotic good. It's a good fun movie, not much deep thinking involved but its an action movie. I am definitely glad I saw it, and saw it in a theater as a fan of marvel films. 
2018-10-06 07:02:56 Very meh. The story was obviously shoved out of the way to get to the action leading to awkward pacing (the main character lost his job, wife, and apartment like 15 mins in) and none of the characters had a lot of motivation and the main bad guy [shouldn't have been killed off like that imo, he was way more interesting than riot and should've stayed as the main villain until the end or near the very end.](#spoiler)

Also that post credits scene was the icing on the cake that showed me it was really just sequel bait for Sony's incoming onslaught of spin offs and sequels. Overall, I don't recommend.
2018-10-05 06:40:43 Sony is doing such a mixed job with Spider-Man. The Spider-Man game on PS4 was fantastic, but then they make garbage like Venom.
2018-10-08 08:01:49 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've gotta say, *that was actually more entertaining* than I expected. I was expecting like a Suicide Squad or BvS level mess where it's just choppy and dull the whole time, but there's enough weird here that it could aaaaaalmost become a cult classic. I think the movies biggest sin is that the first part before he gets infected is simply way too long. I think they should have just kicked it off with Brock sneaking into the crash site somehow and getting infected and just rolling with 90 minutes of insane shit. I feel like they could have really trimmed some stuff, like we didn't *really* need the first scene where he goes to the convenience store. I get that it's to set up the bit at the end, but if you want your superhero to stop a store getting robbed, just do it! Like, the original robocop doesn't have a scene where Murphy watches a store get robbed before he's Robocop and he can't do anything because he's off duty or whatever, they just have a scene where Robocop's patrolling, he sees the store get held up, and he goes in and freaks the guy out and saves the store. That's all ya need!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Anyway*, once Eddie finally gets infected, this movie shifts gears and becomes almost this advant garde superhero version of *Vampire's Kiss* or something. Tom Hardy felt like he was playing a Nicolas Cage role, and I think he deserves a ton of credit for actually selling it. With all the cgi put on we have the context, but when he was on set acting these scenes he probably was just told "Okay, you go HNNNNNNG and flap your arms around and we'll do the rest in post". The stuff between him and the symbiote was gold and he completely sold a guy who was just confused by every single thing that's happening but has to go along with it because this bullshit is his life now. It's legitimately one of the great *weird* performances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past Hardy's brilliance there are still some problems. I really really wanted more of Riz Ahmad. I loved the weird little offhand things he said where he basically lets slip that he's really unhinged but at the same time he tries not to be too weird, but there's so little of him doing that and I wanted more. I really think if we'd seen a bit more between him and Riot that could have had some great weird comedy akin to the dynamic with Eddie and Venom. I do tend to wonder if some of that was lost in that 30 or 40 minutes that was cut and I think if there's an extended version the overlong first part might not feel so bloated in comparison.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, it's not quite as good as it could have been, but not nearly as bad as I expected either. I'm still lukewarm on the Silver and Black thing if they're still doing that, but I actually would love to see more of this incarnation of Venom. The movie itself could have used another editing pass or two but the character itself was great, and I do appreciate that it felt genuinely different from a real Marvel movie without being way too self-serious like a DC movie. I honestly do want to see that Carnage sequel and would probably love an extended cut.
2018-10-12 02:12:43 Movie is so bad but funny
2018-10-14 07:14:37 1.	Other than the car chase, all the best material was in the trailers.
2.	Did I really just sit through what seemed like 20 minutes of credits to see a clip of Into the Spider-Verse?
3.	The astronauts brought back four organisms: Venom, Riot, and two others. What happened to those other two???
4.	How did Riot know what the company was just by looking at a patch, and how did he know where to find it?
5.	How do symbiotes that live on an asteroid have English words for names, and how many movies before we get to meet Venom's third cousin Phlegm?

2018-10-05 06:32:38 I liked Tom Hardy as Brock, j just felt he should have been more slimey and shitty. Not bad, but a really sleazy journalist that takes advantage of people.  Then when he joins with venom, venoms the one to give us exposition on his past actions with Anne.
2018-10-05 09:22:12 How did the little girl get possessed by the symbiote and appear at the airport? Didnt see her before in the film
2018-10-05 09:39:35 Outside of the mumbling Tom Hardy gave an amazing performance in a pretty shitty movie. Some action scenes were pretty fun but that’s literally the only good thing about the movie outside Tom Hardy. 

Really confused about this movie :/

First end credit scene was fun though
2018-10-05 23:20:38 Anyone else not happy the "it's not all bad" "I can't tell you how much you're scaring me right now" scene was cut?
2018-10-07 21:25:27 Completely agree. Wasn’t a fan of Life either but it still fits so perfectly together. 
2018-10-12 14:14:38 It was a *decent* entertaining movie.  Therefore worth watching.
2018-10-05 06:13:04 This is in no way a good movie but it is way better than the kicking it has been getting on twitter the past few days.
2018-10-06 05:48:48 This was a really good movie. Every critic just likes to jump on the hate train but watch it for yourself. Really good
2018-10-10 07:32:29 Watched antman and wasp in imax 3d, and avengers infinity war, but I could easily see this being better than both, in terms of embracing who the character is and not fisting in a joke in ever 2 seconds like the latter did. Venoms attempt at humor came naturally from the conflict of who eddie and the symbiote are as individuals, some have said a buddy cop way, and I'd agree. I was torn initially like most were when the trailer hit, I immediately thought Sony shit the bed, a waste of tom hardy's talent, and yet somehow, this movie has staying power, from its depiction of venoms abilities to the down to earth grime that brock had found himself in, I can easily see myself watching this in the theaters again and plan on it. I saw it in imax 3d lead to believe there was imax exclusive scenes, I didnt see shit, and I'm a stickler for that sort of thing, so save a view bucks and watch it in a regular theater in 2d, as 3d didnt add much depth and detracted from some scenes because of how dark it can get.

On a scale of 100, I'd say venom is easily a 79/100.
2018-10-05 08:23:01 Matthew Libatique's second best superhero movie and second best movie this weekend.
2018-10-05 10:06:20 Bobby Fish said he was going to donate a kidney to his daughter in Luke Cage, but he was really just going back to his job as CEO of a big news company.
2018-10-06 07:58:08 I'm still gonna see it lol i dont mind a dumb/cheesy 90s throwback.
2018-10-07 02:12:49 masstagger is lighting the fuck up in this thread on people who like this movie and i just think the overlap is funny.
2018-10-07 04:07:13 Well seems like Sony  is rolling in the bank with this 
2018-10-08 00:51:07 Venom is the only remotely good character. Hardy does Eddy well but Hardy is kind of expected to at this point. I genuinely believe this movie would have greatly benefited from a hard R but we won’t get that until the Hardy-cut is released when the home release happens.
2018-10-12 02:38:02 Not a spoiler or anything related to seeing the movie since I haven't yet but....

there has to be other people out there who thinks that in the trailer Tom Hardy sounds like Professor Frink 
2018-10-06 02:28:59 lol..34 on metacritic. Lower than my prediction of 42.  I stand by my prediction Morbious will never get made.  This Venom movie was a fucking stupid idea from jump street and so too is Morbious.  Fuck Sony.
2018-10-14 07:38:36 I didn't think it was very good at all.

I'm not a huge comic book guy but Hardy seemed miscast from the beginning for a character who's supposed to be a "loser". The acting was a bit wooden at points, the writing was pretty off ("turd in the wind"?), and the plot wasn't terribly engaging.

Hopefully, they let Spider-Man just continue to swing through the MCU and don't drag that down either.
2018-10-05 08:25:57 The only thing I liked about the movie was carnage and the preview for into the spider verse 
2018-10-05 06:06:24 [deleted]
2018-10-05 08:19:04 The movie is great, please don't let reviews ruin a awesome movie. It's a blast, has great cast. Not all marvel characters are gonna have a super thought out story. The cgi it's what venom is supposed to look like. Just watch the movie don't let Disney and there reviewers ruin it.
2018-10-08 04:53:10 Well. This was kind've a disaster wasn't it.

Who's looking forward to Into the Spider-Verse this december? Can't wait to see how Sony effs that up. 
2018-10-05 08:24:13 I want it to do well enough to warrant a sequel. I just want more of Woody harrelson's character, and what he would do with that character.
2018-10-06 02:54:34 Wow this was honestly a really bad movie. It was barely considered "fun". It would be awesome if a large studio could rival Disney in terms of creating fantasy/sci fi worlds and creating a story. Almost all of Marvel and Star Wars has been mediocre to bad recently. I feel like they have gotten way too comfortable with their "safe" movie telling formula. 
2018-10-06 03:12:31 I walked out. Haven't done that in years for any movie.
2018-10-19 21:58:33 I dont understand people defending it. It's definitely one of the worst movies ive seen all year.
2018-10-05 08:54:13 Man, the CGI was so poor for a movie that needed to rely heavily on it, and the writing/dialogue was actually so bad it was funny lol.
2018-10-05 21:30:02 I can't believe this movie is gonna be a hit...
2018-10-09 20:06:51 These YouTube movie critics all are on the same page with RT, completely trashed it with no original opinions.
2018-10-06 01:53:35 [deleted]
2018-10-06 02:17:45 At least it was short.
2018-10-06 11:08:19 Bad Cgi, bad script, bad humour-seriousness hybridisation. Bad. But not as bad as some Marvel productions we saw in the last years; at least we can say they tried to do something slightly different here, and even if for just a couple minutes, sometimes it works.
2018-10-07 05:52:29 [deleted]
2018-10-05 08:13:51 Between this, Rogue One and Jason Bourne, Riz Ahmed is slowly becoming the new "only good actor in a bad major franchise film".

EDIT: Ok, I wrote this poorly. I do know of Rogue One's critical reception and should not have called it bad like it is an objective fact. Hell same goes for Venom and JB. 
2018-10-05 09:53:41 paid 2.50 to watch it (10 dollars off from amazon and atom codes combined) and it still wasn't worth it. Literally there is one good scene in the film - the end credit with carnage.

&#x200B;

How can you mess up a story and character as cool as venom and you have tom hardy? wtf? how to execs let this shit air after watching their cut. 
2018-10-05 20:43:55 [deleted]
2018-10-07 00:13:28 Awful. Kinda wish that after-credits scene wasn't leaked months ago, right down to the specific actor.

Edit: https://desuarchive.org/co/thread/98657312/#98657312 and https://bloody-disgusting.com/comics/3501029/woody-harrelson-confirms-venom-role-stokes-fire-carnage-rumor-spoilers/ since some of you don't believe me. 
2018-10-09 19:35:30 Why does everyone gush over comic book adaptations? Is it really that interesting to see comic book characters portrayed as fake-looking CGI?

&#x200B;

Shit film, 3/10.
2018-10-05 06:49:19 BEST MOVIE EVAR!!
2018-10-06 03:05:25 And Sam raimi’s Venom is a million times superior and scarier then the crap we got in this movie. 
2018-10-10 01:50:38 Venom is garbage for people with low standards. Now hit downvote crybabies.
2018-10-05 19:39:40 Anyone notice the big hate towards this, from the Caca fan club?

Edit: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/03/lady-gaga-fans-credited-with-negative-venom-buzz
2018-10-07 06:48:45 I went in with no expectations and was quite underwhelmed. It wasn't unwatchable like Catwoman for example, but it's still a far cry from the standard you expect from Marvel movies nowadays.

This Venom without Spiderman universe is kinda meh to me . 
2018-10-10 08:47:24 Nothing about this film was good. Tom Hardy was FINE, not great. Nobody else could have played the role, but I still wasn’t blow away by his performance. The film also feels like it came from 2004. Everything just seemed off: the filming style, the dialogue, the tone

Riz Ahmed was horribly miscast. His dialogue delivery was hard to watch and very forced. I can’t get over how bad his character was. It didn’t help that the entire script was also a mess.

It tried to be funny, and wasn’t necessarily very funny. The action sequences were also boring. It has a terrible car chase scene that I was horribly bored of, I truly didn’t care what happened in it. To be honest, none of the action sequences blew me away (especially the climax of the film). 

The entire movie is a whole bunch of “who care” and lacks any real anxiety or excitement. What a let down.
2018-10-08 06:30:44 I reckon this is the second best Sony Marvel film out there, home coming tops it of course. 
2018-10-09 01:31:37 It's interesting to read the "reviews" (ha!) on IMDB. Tons and tons of texts are exactly alike. "DON'T LISTEN TO DA CRITICZ! It's great! THE CRITICS ARE WRONG!!!"


I wonder if they are shills or just really, really, really easy to please. 

2018-10-07 08:59:59 Ok, so Venom. Decent movie.

They nailed Venom, but missed the mark completely on Eddie Brock, and the origin as a whole that makes it way more meaningful in a Spider-Man universe. 

I had no idea where the plot was going, or really what it was, until maybe the last 30 minutes. 

Tom Hardy was the worst part of it.

New Run the Jewels after the mid-credit scene. Fucking *sweet*

Also, the mid-credit scene is the best one in all of the movies, ever. It's a character I have been waiting for since the first Spider-Man in 2001. And they got Woody Fucking Harrelson. 

Overall, it's a movie that exists. A good theater popcorn movie, but I can not wait for the sequel.

Also, that movie needed to be rated R. PG-13 held it back, to me.

7/10

2018-10-05 21:08:46 What a silly movie, some of that is good, most of it bad...Tom Hardy doesn't disappoint however.

&#x200B;

My review: 

[https://italianimposter.com/2018/10/05/venom-isnt-art-or-entertainment/](https://italianimposter.com/2018/10/05/venom-isnt-art-or-entertainment/)
2018-10-08 09:28:34 Peoples response to a classic horror movie: they killed a dog in it, So I didnt like it.

Peoples response to this average Venom film: they killed Both a Dog and a little girl in it...I REALLY enjoyed it.
2018-10-08 22:06:12 Absolute disappointment for so many reasons imo. The two big things that rubbed me the wrong way. Why does venom have dialogue like my college Roomate. He's an evil symbiotic virus thing, stupid. Oh that leads right into number 2... I thought this dude was a villain. Why the hell is this another pg superhero movie. His dialogue felt comparable to deadpool, except I thought he was supposed to be a fucking villain. Stupid.
2018-10-07 08:59:50 The best part of this film is the into the spider- verse clip. 
2018-10-05 07:15:14 CRITICS HATE FUN!!

I LOVED this movie. I am 100% sure I know what it is and its faults but I loved it. It was so funny in both an intentional and unintentional way.

I mean I am being real it wasn't a good movie, but it wasn't thrash. It was very aware of what it was and it works. It was violent enough for being PG13, having to visually see blood would be a stupid criticism of this with all I saw. It didn't need 30/40 minutes more it was a good length and maybe more would make it suck.

I am not sure why but it seems nowadays if it is not like Civil War/Infinity War then it has to suck. I am not saying this sucks like a Justice League since that movie was not good and the jokes fell very flat, but it can be just average and very fun which is what Venom is. I truly want Tom Hardy to continue asd Eddie Brock in another Venom. 

I need the after credits scene to be a reality.

I need this Venom to be included in the MCU...or you know what revive the Raimi Spider-verse for this one character!!

* I think this movie proves Deadpool can work in PG13. It wasn't entirely on purpose but it works.
* What is the deal with both Tom Hardy and Logan Marshall Green having very similar movies about something taking over them in Upgrade/Venom

Man...I know it might be a lost cause but I want this to be popular so that we get more!
2018-10-07 20:53:51 I felt like I waited my whole life for a Venom movie.  So much potential.  But it crashed and burned.  2/10.
2018-10-07 02:01:22 Eddie in the comics is a total psycho, why the hell did they make him a sobby average Joe here instead of an asshole? There's good movies with asshole main characters, Sony, Christ.
2018-10-05 17:00:39 God I am so sick of this site when these comic book movies come out. Instead of having a discussion about what we liked or what we thought didn't work about the movie we fight about whether it's good or not. That rotten tomatoes score pretty much sums it up for me. 
2018-10-06 12:20:42 It's an edgier, funnier, darker version of Deadpool. Loved it. Venom is da homie

2018-10-05 21:08:10 Looks like Disney payed off critics again and made their shills work overtime. This movie is not as bad as the critics are saying. I can't believe they'd lower it than the fucking predator. It was better than fking ant man and the wasp which was a snoozefest
2018-11-27 07:41:17 It’s not a good movie, though it was entertaining.  I watched because of Tom Hardy, but it wasn’t his best effort. Probably about a 2/5
2018-11-29 04:19:28 So a speaker by the launch was loud enough to disturb Venom but a literal fucking rocket ship launching near his face wasn't loud enough to disturb him? 
2018-10-07 10:12:53 I still need to check this movie out.
2018-10-08 14:47:54 I hope they do a Spiderman crossover with Marvel in the near future. All of the leg work for likable villain has been done for Marvel. Maybe the 3rd movie for each of them can be the crossover.
2018-10-11 00:58:57 Absolutely abysmal. Art is dead.
2018-10-05 19:11:32 Question: What was the running time in your showing? I see some critics say it is 140 minutes; the official run time is 112 minutes; but I swear the show I was at Wednesday was 98 minutes or so. Movie began at 7:00pm on the dot, no trailers, and by 8:40 the credits were done (including the Spiderverse clip).

Maybe I missed something? I did not like what I saw... but I'm wondering if there is a different cut of it that might make me... hate it... less?

I just felt there was no story to speak of, and very poor character development - if at all. Plotlines introduced and dropped, complete scenes that served no purpose... And crappy CGI. Heh.

A 2 out of 6 from me.
2018-10-08 17:50:32 SPOILERS!

No explanation as to why Venom looks like Spider-man, even though Spidey is never mentioned in the film.

No explanation as to how or why the symbiotes got to be on a meteor heading to Earth, or how they survived a crash in a broken up space shuttle.

Why are people walking around the crash site in full decontamination gear, while others are walking around as if there is no problem? (Also, the Maylaysian forest roads look just like they could be in North America, strange that).

Riz Ahmed - [edit] what the hell is his motivation with the symbiotes? It's beyond ridiculous that he'd immediately start plugging them into animals and humans. 

The car/bike chase scene is awful, and boring.

The final fight, is awful and boring.

Basically, it is a deeply, deeply, deeply flawed movie. But I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I honestly thought it was better than the utter crappy blandness of Doctor Strange and Black Panther.
2018-10-06 11:02:33 For as terrible as it was we haven’t stopped quoting it. Would get drunk and make fun of it with friends. Also Venoms man crush was very uncomfortable 
2018-10-05 07:39:23 ~~Somebody took (their?) little 3-5 year-old boy and girl to the 8 pm showing I went to. The movie is full of brutal—albeit bloodless—violence, has a couple of extra brutal bloody parts, has assorted swears,  and an obligatory once and done PG-13 F bomb. ~~

Edit:

I have a feeling that it was an entirely personal decision for the parents, none of my business, and therefore was inappropriate to post about it. I am withdrawing my post. 
2018-10-05 08:00:13 Honestly I love how they deviated from even MENTIONING Spiderman.

This movie was a great comic book flick. It had cool action, funny quips, and a villain we all collectively hated. A villain so shitty even Venom disliked him.

Some lines were poorly written and there were some inconsistencies too, but it's a lot better than most. 

RENT?
2018-10-05 20:22:18 Movie was ok, not great but certainly better than some MCU movies by a longshot. The script was terrible at times but Tom Hardy really makes it work in spite of itself. The degree to which this is worse than your average superhero movie has definitely been overstated, in my opinion. I'd say give it a watch. I had fun with it, mostly because of Hardy. Here's hoping he gets to be Venom again. 

Something that confused me about the mid-credits reveal: [didn't the villain in the movie basically already have Carnage's abilities?](#spoiler)
2018-10-05 23:15:57 I fell asleep when the bad guys went to Eddie's apartment to get the symbiote back and when I woke up they were fighting on the rocket. How much of the movie did I miss?
2018-10-06 02:56:50 One of the worst movies of 2018
2018-10-05 19:18:30 I guessed this movie would be 38% 2 weeks ago and that was being generous and overshooting the rating. It’s funny how you can tell how shit a movie is based on its preview and the feeling surrounding the film. Everyone knew these execs had the wrong grand vision for this movie. It looks like we traveled back in time to early 2000s and this is a shit spider man 4 with no spider man. If me (an average viewer) can ballpark the rating based on a first image or preview of a movie, how can these people making millions and being in the industry not notice that their vision is not what people in 2018 want?

2018-10-08 02:12:21 i love tom hardy but damn he was the worst part of this movie. everything else was mediocre but eddie brocks lines and voice were unbearable
2018-10-05 16:23:45 ITT: 0/10 or 10/10s only
2018-10-06 20:00:35 Hahahah, I love how all the Reddit trolls who had been bashing this movie are now gone.

8/10.
2018-10-06 17:42:25 Objectively it was worse than Black Panther, (which is the worst movie I've watched this year) but I enjoyed it way more because this one at least funny. It's great as a comedy movie. The special effects were also better than BP lol. 
2018-10-10 06:40:03 Went and seen Venom tonight. It was essentially"The Room" of super hero movies. Fun and entertaining, but not how the menu it to be. Only thing they got right was the look of Venom.
2018-10-05 06:22:30 [deleted]
2018-10-06 10:12:31 Secondhand embarrassment. I’m sick and tired of these superhero movies talking down to the audience like we’re idiots. That in and of itself conditions audiences to actually become idiots. I was rolling my eyes and liking around myself in the theatre every 3 minutes to see people’s reactions. Dead silent. No reactions or movement anywhere. I must’ve shook my head 58 times while watching this. The dialogue and story was written by a 9 year old. 
2018-10-06 12:39:33 How do they explain that Venom looks similar to Spidey?
2018-10-08 00:59:48 Starts awful, then it becomes boring, then finally entertaining in a trashy B-movie kind of way. Once it embraces how stupid it is it makes it easier to sit through. I don’t want to see it again though, unlike most of my favorite bad movies. The free comic book AMC gave me before the show was better.
2018-10-14 20:33:49 It was a waste of time.Story was predictable,CGI was bad.Thats not i expected.But I exciting for sequel because Woody Harrelson playing Carnage and Tom Hardy is still awesome.

2018-10-18 00:15:49 Hands down worst super hero movie ever. Holy shit is there no redeeming things about this movie at all. I think Tom Hardy is actually mentally deteriorating, but everyone thinks he’s just being artsy.

Wow, seriously all the dialogue in this movie could have been ad libbed and it would have been better. The final fight looked like the old tubes screen saver. Woody harrelson as carrot top? 

I’ve never felt so offended by a movie before

2018-10-08 19:00:58 I literally cried from laughter when Michelle williams said "Dan needs to do another MRI" I cried from laughter because that was such a ridiculous line. The movie was abysmal. Absolutely horrible but I also laughed so hard i cried, unintentional or not. So, I guess I understand why this has been getting positive ratings. I didnt walk out bored or sleepy, i walked out laughing at how ridiculously bad this was. So, it was good?
2018-10-10 15:15:17 Garbage.

r/movies will love it though. What else are they going to do? lol
2018-10-06 21:44:53 Venom is garbage. There isn't much more to say other than that. The film has nothing that works at all, the action is bad, the characters are bad, and the humor is bad. So why all the praise? I have no idea, but I'm not here to praise it, I am here to rip it to shreds. Every technical aspect has flaws. The direction is so hamfisted and uninspired it's almost laughable, that Jimmy Kimmel Live direction experience is very apparent here, all the action scenes are so horribly shot I almost had a seizure from all of these different angles of shooting one scene, every action scene seems as if it was shot by a three-year-old with a 20 dollar Kodak camera from CVS. The cinematography is just as baffling with what I counted as seventeen shots out of focus, how does that happen in 2018, the years where we have monitors so the directors can see if the shot is good or not, it's so lazy it's unacceptable. The color grading is so flat and boring with so many awful mixes of blues, reds, and greens it's just awful. The pacing is abysmal with every scene going by in 30 seconds and then cutting to a random scene with no relation to the former. The pacing is so bad I checked my watch and only 10 minutes had gone by, yet more than 18 to 19 scenes had flown by. The score is just awful, I have nothing more to say on that note. The compositions are boring and comparable to a commercial for the film itself. Now by far, the worst technical aspect is the editing. It's so incoherent and completely ruins the film, the fight scenes are ruined by the cuts and quick inserts just to make it feel so rushed and almost unwatchable because all of the angles they choose are cut together so quickly that you have to turn off your brain just to get any enjoyment out of it. The action is so unintentionally boring because every little thing has no tension at all, it's like Black Panther's problem where none of the events unfolding will affect the protagonist because he's invincible! All of the action has no excitement because everything has no effect on Venom. The CGI is awful as well, every symbiote just looks like the slime my brother used to make in the backyard. The designs are just awful and have no place among modern superhero films like The Dark Knight, Spider-man 2, and Logan. Honestly, Spider-man 3 has the better animation for Venom than this film.

The writing is as abysmal as the rest of the film. It's sloppy, unintelligent, and boring; the story they came up with is so cliche and contrived it's like a toddler wrote it. You could easily cut the first 10 minutes out and just start at the crash site with the symbiotes and it would make more sense. One of the bigger problems is the characters have no motivation, I guess the villain kind of has one, but it's so basic and underdeveloped it has no standing at all. Our villain is basically a worse mixture of Steppenwolf and Malikith. Venom is so passive as a character he's boring to watch, everything happens to him and he causes nothing; he simply reacts. The dialogue is nothing above garbage, I can't find anything worse than garbage to call it. All of the lines spoken are so unnatural I have no idea what they were thinking, especially since most of the lines are Eddie makes a comment and Venom says a comedy relief statement to make everyone in the theater laugh at his abysmal character, scratch that, his idea of a character because nothing is fleshed out. The script is literally a combination of events happening with no continuity, substance, or coherency. The story is boring and the plot follows it's footsteps. All of these elements are god awful and seem like the script was written before a good movie ever came out, so they had nothing to go off of. None of the emotional beats are hit with any accuracy, one single segment can sum up how awful these beats are; I'm of course speaking of the Eddie gets fired and then fiance breaks up with Eddie segment. It happens so fast I couldn't even process how bad it was, but this segment basically sums up this entire film. Things happen to fast and characters change at such a fast pace, I have no idea how no one stopped and said: "This script sucks, let's re-write." It's just awful, I have no other words for it.

Now the things people have been praising this film for, the characters... Every single character sucks, not a single performance is good. The villain is just a boring philosophical douche bag with no development of clear motive beyond, "I think symbiotes could help me move people to space." He just spouts hilarious attempts at biblical interpretation to further his own self-interest. Our protagonist is, of course, boring and tasteless, with no inner-conflict or any character trait besides: "I follow people, who don't want to be followed." It's garbage character writing and just lazy. The love interest is the best character, but that's not saying much because we're comparing Michelle Willaims to Suicide Squad level bad performances, but none the less she does the best with her awful character and lines as possible. All side characters just feel thrown in to fill the movie's runtime, and then we get to Venom. Venom sucks, he has no character, and his whole reasoning for not obeying orders from the head honcho Riot is: "I like this planet, cause I was a loser on my planet like you, Eddie." All his character is, is this slimy black thing that speaks to Eddie and makes him do things without any input from Eddie, besides asking Venom to come out to protect him. Venom was not interesting enough to have a standalone film, Venom is nothing without Spider-man and this film just proves that for me. All in all this film fails miserably in every aspect of film-making if I ever make something this bad I will jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. Would give it a 0, but not possible so: 0.5/5
2018-10-06 22:44:03 LHD van in Malaysia was annoying. Pretty sure Malaysia has left hand traffic so RHD cars.

Unless someone from Malaysia can tell me otherwise.

Also this was a fun movie if you view as a weird satire comedy thing. 
2018-10-11 15:43:50 There's a good movie in here when it involves Venom. This film feels very poorly edited and the script is horrible. "Looks like I got awesome new friends" while escaping on the motorcycle was just awful!
2018-10-08 02:34:29 Ranks:

1. Spider-Man 2
2. Spider-Man
3. Spider-Man Homecomings
4. Spider-Man 3
5. Venom
6. The Amazing Spider-Man
7. The Amazing Spider-Man 2

I still have to admit TASM 1 & 2 were trash but Venom is arguably Ben Affleck's Daredevil 2.0, in my opinion. It won't be a cult classic in the future by any mean. Oh, and it's better than the crappy, cash-grab Batman v Superman.
2018-10-05 18:02:05 I can't believe Michelle Williams agreed to star in this. She's better than this Marvel shite. 
2018-10-07 09:00:22 This movie is a shitty version of Upgrade.
2018-10-09 10:50:23 Best description I've heard of Venom so far, that I just want to echo here:

It's like they found a forgotten movie canister from 2001 and just released it now.

Venom is exactly the same kind of big, ridiculous, anachronisticly-bad movie as Spiderman 3.
2018-10-08 20:47:50 i lvoed it i dont know why people keep complaining about it being too funny. there are intense scenes in here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybDPJYan3c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybDPJYan3c)
2018-10-05 06:51:13 Wow...Something different.

Something ACTUALLY different.

No, Venom is no masterpiece. The villain is about as underwritten, uninteresting and bland as they come (With an awful performance from Riz Ahmed to boot) and it's blatantly obvious the film would have benefited from an R-rating, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight.

Tom Hardy is perfect, as both Eddie Brock and Venom. As Eddie Brock, he's likable, goofy, charmingly dorky and incredibly sympathetic. As Venom, he's darkly hilarious, witty and commands an incredible screen presence. And his chemistry with Michelle Williams' Anne Weying (As both characters) is off the charts. This may be my favorite romance in a comic book movie. It starts off and ends off genuinely adorable, but isn't afraid to cover the more painful and stressful parts of their relationship either. It felt way more genuine to me than any other love story I've seen in a superhero movie (With a hilarious, but oddly romantic, "WTF" moment in the 3rd act.)

Michelle Williams is excellent in her own right too. She's charismatic, intelligent, strong and has some surprisingly good comedic timing of her own. I've missed the days when love interests in comic book movies had genuine character arcs, so Williams' Weying was another breath of fresh air in a comic book movie already full of them.

The comedy is definitely the highlight. This is by far the funniest comic book film I've seen to date, it puts both Deadpool movies to shame. It's very reminiscent of a John Landis or Sam Raimi horror comedy from the 80s. Complete batshit insanity in the best way. There's a particular scene in a restaurant that had me laughing so hard my lungs hurt.

While the neutered PG-13 rating definitely stings a lot, you'd be surprised how much the movie gets away with. The film is surprisingly violent (To the point where my theater occasionally gasped) and there are moments of genuine suspense and terror here. No, it definitely doesn't generate screams, but as a theater experience, it may generate some chills and jumps.

As for the story, again, it's not particularly deep, but its clever in its own way, and has its admitted emotional moments regarding Anne and Eddie's relationship. The film works as a very interesting anti-Spider-Man movie; while Peter suffers and loses people he loves from his obligation to responsibility, Eddie loses people he loves from his own lack of responsibility. Even Eddie's relationship with his suit serves as a dark mirror to Spider-Man; in Homecoming, Peter has to learn that he doesn't need the suit to be a hero. In Venom, Eddie needs the friendship of his own suit to save the day.

Venom is not perfect. It's not quite as great as I had hoped. But it's the farthest thing from bad. It has more heart and brains than critics are giving it credit for and it's a desperately needed original take on a genre that's admittedly been suffering from repetition, exhaustion and over-saturation.  It's definitely more interesting, bold and rewatchable than half of the easily disposable and forgettable MCU films.  And I think I'm gonna go watch it again tomorrow.
2018-10-05 07:45:19 > [I can't say I'm surprised with critics. With the exception of Wonder Woman, most of the critics finds an excuse to hate a superhero movie that isn't in the MCU. That's a distressing trend I've noticed lately and I worry that it's going to get worse before it gets better.](https://np.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/9ko2x7/venom_early_reactions_tom_hardys_movie_belongs_in/e70q2g5/)

2018-10-06 05:54:49 Guess I'll watch A Star is Born instead
2018-10-07 20:41:12 The fact that this piece of garbage has a 89% audience rating is just baffling to me. When stuff like this and Ant-Man 2 get good audience reception, it proves to me audiences have lost all standards.

2018-10-05 07:57:39 Just saw Venom AMA
2018-10-04 22:21:53 This venom fan since 1988 gives the movie 7.5/10.
2018-10-04 22:06:07 You need to try this SC lens
2018-10-05 07:47:12 I thought this sub might like my sleeve. This picture is a few years old, before it was filled in.
2018-10-05 16:27:18 what did the second end credit scene imply? *spoilers*
2018-10-05 06:33:07 Bit of a Venom fan since childhood. Saw the movie a couple nights ago. Loved it. What's a good place to start in the comics?

2018-10-05 08:26:53 Symbiotes ranked best to worst (in my opinion)
2018-10-04 19:36:18 What Kind of Symbiote Is Venom?
2018-10-04 20:32:03 Google no longer displays IMDB review percentage
2018-10-04 19:16:23 Makes you wonder if some people just deliberatly want the cinemas to go bankerupt. So what if the movies are released the same date. Most people going to watch Venom is not going to watch a star is born anyways, and so goes the other way

2018-09-17 23:27:18 What if? Very unlikely to happen, but as a big fan of ASM/Garfield Spidey I would publicly freak out over this moment.
2018-09-17 20:47:58 Saw that no has yet removed the words from the IMAX poster. So I did it myself. Hope y'all like!

2018-08-01 21:27:06 Why 'Venom' Feels Like a Throwback to an Earlier Era [x-post /r/Marvel]

2018-08-01 22:21:54 Medicom MAFEX Venom at Summer Wonder Festival 2018
2018-09-26 07:57:25 "Great for a Sony movie" isn't a glowing sentiment, honestly.
2018-09-26 07:49:05 I heard the actual venom suit in its entirety only has a handful of minutes worth of screen time 
2018-09-26 07:47:59 Because the internet is flush with cynical people
2018-09-26 07:49:20 I'm betting its gonna suck. That said hopefully I am presently surprised. 
2018-09-26 08:11:31 Honestly I'm really not into the "badass" vibe the trailers try to sell. The fact it doesn't have Spider-Man in a Venom story doesn't help, but if the trailer looked the same I'd not be into it anyway. The trailers really didn't sell it for me.

For something that goes on a "darker" route and is different from MCU but in a good way, there's Legion. The trailer for New Mutants looks great too.
2018-10-06 07:23:57 I agree, the movie was really good, what most people say about the movie is just their own opinion, but in my opinion i liked the movie
2018-09-26 09:37:18 1. Because in the comics, both Eddie Brock and the symbiote's origins tie into Spider-Man but won't in the movie.  2. It's rating is PG-13 and, for some reason, everybody wanted it rated R.
2018-09-26 19:19:21 It looks like shit, plain and simple. Tom Hardy is the only redeeming factor, because he's as sexy as sin, but a hot lead does not equal a good movie.
2018-09-26 08:10:58 Personally not *that* interested in any Marvel movie not in the MCU. 

I'll definitely see it though ...eventually.
2018-09-26 08:16:02 This is why Im not to hype for it , and I love everything Marvel. Needless to say I'll still watch it lol
2018-09-26 17:52:52 I agree it doesn't look as bad as everyone has said. However it being a pg13 and the fact the review embargo hasn't been lifted so close to it's release are all bad signs.
2018-09-27 04:00:59 I couldn't say for certain, but I think people are hating on the movie because it looks really stupid across the board. I mean, that's why *I* would hate on the movie, if I cared enough to bother. 
2018-10-20 08:21:02 I haven't seen it, but I know people who really enjoyed it.
2018-09-26 17:19:10 from most of the trailers Hardy isn't that great in this role
2018-09-26 07:49:20 Glad I’m not the only one who actually thinks the Venom movie might be good
2018-09-26 08:31:59 There are people that hate that Venom won’t be connected to Spider-Man plus it’s Sony trying to do their own thing and they have a poor track record with hardcore fans since Spider-Man 3.
2018-10-08 16:12:29 **Films on follow list with updates**

* **Incredibles 2 -** Did I mention that superhero films are still really goddamn popular? Because if you needed more proof look at Incredibles 2 which just surpassed Iron Man 3 to become 5th highest grossing superhero film worldwide with $1.22B. But next year, oh man better watch out for that superhero fatigue. It's coming this time, I swear!

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **Free Solo -** The doc about a free solo climber climbing El Capitan expanded well to 40 theaters this weekend to $540K, a per theater average of $13K. Oooh that climbing puns I could make you have no idea.
* **The Hate U Give -** The film based on the popular YA book about a young black girl dealing with the fallout of a fatal police shooting opened in limited this week to $500k in 36 theaters for a great $13,889 per theater average. The film should expand to 200+ theaters next weekend as it slowly builds hype.

**Notable film closings**

* **Mile 22 -** While the partnership of Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg decided to step away from covering recent tragedies, their latest did just as poorly as their non-fiction work as Mile 22 closed this week to a pretty weak $36.1M domestic and $59.9M worldwide on a budget of $50M. The film, which was intended to start an action franchise for Marky Mark, received atrocious reviews and came out far under Crazy Rich Asians and The Meg which are still running and making decent coin. Oh well, we may not have a franchise but we'll always have [those crazy screaming matches between the editor and the director.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-zL7Hh_FI/)
* **The Spy Who Dumped Me** \- The latest attempt to finally make Kate McKinnon a mainstream thing once again did not take off the ground as The Spy Who Dumped Me closed to an underwhelming $33.5M domestic and $66M worldwide on a budget of $40M. The film co-starring Kate McKinnon clearly wanted to capture some of that Spy female comedy magic that Spy managed in 2015 but it could just never find the right audience and dropped like a rock after its initial opening.
* **The Happytime Murders** \- Oh The Happytime Murders how unsurprising your bombing was as the raunchy muppet R-rated comedy closed this week to a terrible $20.7M domestic and $25.1M worldwide on a budget of $40M. The film was a passion project of Brian Henson (A Muppet Christmas Carol) for years with word of the film first coming out all the way back in 2008. It went through massive amounts of production companies and different lead female stars before finally coming out to some truly awful marketing and even worse reviews. The film cost a lot of money because of the various technologies that had to be invented or refined to pull off complicated puppetry shots. Overall this is a classic example of just because you can doesn't mean you should.
* **Kin** \- Shockingly this is a movie that really exists despite mounting evidence it does not. This film that supposedly is real closed to a disastrous $5.7M domestic and $9.8M worldwide on a budget of $30M. The rights for the film, which is based on an acclaimed short, were bought for a whopping $30M at SXSW and got a pretty sizable cast to show up. However delays and studio concern pushed it back and back before it was finally dumped out at the end of August and opening at #12. Or at least that's what they want you to think.

2018-10-08 17:50:57 Everyone I talked to told me two things about Venom

1. That this was an awful movie.

2.  That it was wildly entertaining.

This thing felt like a time capsule film, like they cracked open a sealed container from 2000 and this film was in it.
2018-10-08 17:10:45 KNOCK KNOCK LET THE BOX OFFICE IN
2018-10-08 16:40:09 Well, shit. We're getting this rogue Spidey-verse whether we want it or not.
2018-10-08 16:59:05 I'm curious, has Tom Hardy proven himself as a commercial leading man at this point? Mad Max and now Venom, at least so far, seem to be successes. Not sure how many films it takes. 

I wasn't big too big on the film, but I love Hardy in blockbusters. Yes of course Fury Road was better.
2018-10-08 17:05:38 I'm not sure what's worse, Venom having done well so that people on reddit complain about it endlessly or having had it do poorly so in two months people on reddit talk about how it was secretly good.
2018-10-08 17:24:52 >A Star is Born (2018) (cont.) - I got nothing to say here, I just wanted to take another look at ya. :]

I love you for this!
2018-10-08 16:53:17 Oh, man. I hope this means we get a Venom sequel with Eddie and Venom raising [their](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5bf17640abe774dc7737a9d1105dacd/tumblr_pg8zefgWIg1vd8k0v_1280.jpg) Symbiotic [baby](https://66.media.tumblr.com/431f410541adeee467fc10e69390623e/tumblr_pg8zehLfD31vd8k0v_1280.jpg) together. Because sometimes a family can be a human loser, a loser tentacle monster, and a baby tentacle monster. 

Also, I expect the cut footage was all the tentacle fucking. At least that is what the fanart is telling me. So many people I follow online have suddenly gotten into that. 
2018-10-08 16:48:37 I wonder what this does for the current marvel/Sony deal? does this push Sony to try and get their universe in the MCU? does this give Sony confidence to simply yank Spiderman out of the MCU? so many questions?
PS: alot of people seem to think that this is in the MCU. it never occurred to me that people tend to not notice the difference between Fox-marvel, MCU and Sony-marvel.
2018-10-08 17:18:35 Well, damn, now Sony probably sees themselves confirmed in that their "Spiderman Universe without Spiderman" can work and will flood the theaters with spin-offs about every secondary and tertiary Spiderman villain they can google.

And when those continue to get negative reviews, they will eventually flop and then Sony won't blame themselves.
2018-10-08 17:48:48 I’m thinking A Star is Born is going to blow up on word of mouth and hold close or even do better next week. It was just so good. 
2018-10-08 18:34:00 Getting movies about Venom and Carnage is good and all, but when are we going to get a movie about the most notorious Spider-Man villian of all time: Big Wheel
2018-10-08 20:04:37 Boy, that superhero fatigue... sure is taking a hell of a long time to get here.
2018-10-08 17:21:57 So is Smallfoot any good?
2018-10-08 18:32:41 Word of mouth may help out Venom. The reviews are bad, but everyone i've talked to that's seen it has liked the movie (including me). Gonna be interesting to see how things fold out. 
2018-10-08 17:29:07 I'm expecting 'A Star is Born' to have great legs. It's skewing to the right demographics, it's an incredible film and emotions were definitely running high at the end of the screening I went to. 
2018-10-08 18:00:58 Damn, mixed feelings. On one hand, good for Venom. On the other, I heard rumors that this is gonna make Sony try to mess with Spiderman in the MCU. Hope Sony keeps their filthy hands away from pulling him out of the MCU
2018-10-08 16:53:47 I legitimately didn’t know that “The Spy Who Dumped Me” came out in theaters already.
2018-10-08 17:20:17 Is there some milestone Deadpool 2 is trying to hit? If not, I don't know why it's still out.
2018-10-08 18:08:06 I am blown the fuck away that so many people wanted to see Venom.
2018-10-08 20:02:41 Hell yeah, I’m so happy for Tom Hardy. I really hope the success of this movie gives him more creative control over the sequel.


2018-10-08 18:57:42 I can't stop thinking about A Star Is Born, it was really good from beggining to end and I wouldn't have even minded if it was an hour longer, I was really invested in the story and characters. I hope and believe it'll continue to do really well
2018-10-08 18:11:01 All right, so Venom 2 is coming then. Hopefully they get better fucking writers for the next one cause the first one needed soooo much rewrites. Also more focus on Hardy's Venom and Eddie relationship, easily the highest highlight of the movie.

Also let Tom Hardy help have a more involved in the behind the scenes stuff for future films. Oh and Marvel too.
2018-10-08 19:26:05 Glad to see A Star is Born did well although, I’m not surprised and I’d bet on this movie having some great legs because it was really damn good. 

Some of the best chemistry I’ve seen between a couple/family, great soundtrack plus the way it hits ya emotionally just creates a great experience. 

Also, I go to the movies a lot and I actually had a first when I went to this one. Nothing to do with the movie although the woman next to me did clap after every Gaga song which whatever, the songs were great (even if she can’t hear the applause through a fucking movie screen) but she also brought a lap dog that stayed surprisingly quiet although I was shocked to say the least when something started licking my hand. Not the end of the world, but just wanted to mention it because it was so bizarre...like who brings their dog to the movies? 
2018-10-08 17:58:57 >* **A Star is Born (2018) (cont.) -** I got nothing to say here, I just wanted to take another look at ya. :]

I love this so much
2018-10-08 18:42:30 I saw *A Star is Born* last night. I was very unprepared for how good it was. I'll definitely be giving it a repeat viewing in theaters.
2018-10-08 20:32:43 Damn I loved Venom. Thought the trailers were bad (Sony marketed this movie all wrong) and then the reviews. I was expecting a mess. By the time the credits rolled, I forgot all about it. Just a ton of fun. The audience I saw it with seemed really engaged. Laughed when you should. Still can’t wait to see A Star is Born and First Man. October is going to be a great month for movies. 
2018-10-08 18:01:21 The shocking thing about Venom was how young the crowd was. About 50% of the audience was kids in my showing. 
2018-10-08 18:18:09 I wanted to hate Venom, after seeing it now I want more Venom films. Seriously, it’s flawed, but a lot of fun. It’s  not even remotely close to films like SS and Catwoman. I know we want Spider-Man rights back to Marvel. But, I’ll see where this new universe goes. But I would prefer another standalone Venom film first. I don’t think Morbius or Black Cat films will sell.
2018-10-08 20:35:51 I kept getting fucking downvoted for saying that Venom would make bank despite poor reviews. Most people don't care, they enjoy schlock. I think people just wanted to believe that Venom would do poorly so that Sony would sell Spidey back to Disney or something.
2018-10-08 17:48:33 A Star Is Born is going to have crazy legs, I’m glad it’s a hit it deserves it so much!
2018-10-08 19:55:07 I thought Venom was great. Masterpiece? No, but a lot of the movie critics are goin overboard with the hate. The movie was really fun to watch. Hardy nails it as Eddie. The biggest reason I enjoyed the movie: THEY DID VENOM RIGHT. Spiderman 3 butchered Venom so fucking bad. Now I can forget about it. I can't wait for the next Venom.
2018-10-08 16:57:02 [deleted]
2018-10-08 21:12:17 Saw A Star is Born on Friday and I genuinely haven’t stopped thinking about it. Cooper was incredible, the work he did in preparing to be a rockstar paid off massively and his ability to act drunk/high/broken was mesmerising and totally convincing. I was pleasantly surprised with Gaga, I mean yeah we know she can sing and the performances were great, but she can also act... and not badly. So pleased I saw this movie. 
Cried so much. Actually all of my friends and I did... Soundtrack goes in the car as of tomorrow. 
2018-10-08 22:49:38 WE ARE VENOM
2018-10-08 18:22:58 Does the new Halloween have the potential to steal the October title from Venom? The reviews so far are pretty positive and with last year's "IT" numbers, I think it's possible! 
2018-10-08 19:16:51 Saw A Star is Born twice and Venom once already. A Star is Born may be my new favorite film this year... And Venom wasn't too bad either. It was a really fun movie. 
2018-10-08 17:48:23 A Star is Born is the third remake, fourth film overall. 
2018-10-08 16:57:33 How’s Bucky Larson Born to be a Star doing 
2018-10-09 09:48:13 Fucking lol at Venom doing good. You all thought wrong. 
2018-10-08 18:41:30 My opinion. Venom sucked when venom nor Tom hardy were not on screen. when they were on screen, it was absolutely brilliant, one of the best "split personalities" I've seen on film. and the best part is, most of the movie is Venom and Tom Hardy
2018-10-08 18:19:00 We're actually going have to deal with the No Spiderman Universe. Say goodbye to MCU Kraven
2018-10-08 20:23:27 Despite Venom having abysmal initial criticism and literally set up to fail, it has broken the October weekend record and done well with audiences.

Excuse me, what the fuck?

I haven’t seen this much critic/audience disconnect since The Last Jedi.
2018-10-08 18:20:29 A star is born was solid. Great ending though there were some incredibly slow parts. Also weird when they sing together for the first time. She only sang one verse before and all the sudden the band has the music ready & the lead knows the song. Less than a day passed!!!!
2018-10-08 18:16:36 I guess we'll never see MCU Venom now. 
2018-10-08 19:02:37 Great for *A Star Is Born*.  It was a fantastic movie, and now I'll be paying attention to the Oscars next year.

&#x200B;

> Of course the big part of that is the Gaga of it all with her little  monsters pushing opening weekends and trolling people online over Venom. 

I doubt that the "little monsters" had much to do with anything.  The theater I went to was filled with mostly middle aged adults (who loved the film).  Plus, plenty of legit critics were already singing the movie's praises...trolling was not necessary.

&#x200B;

*Venom* is the surprise to me, with that massive box office take.  

&#x200B;
2018-10-08 21:33:03 "Turd in the Wind" fuckin' grossed over 200 million. Let that sink in.
2018-10-08 16:30:01 Strangely a lot of praise on reddit for Venom. I thought it was a huge disappointment and waste of potential. Fight scenes were cool, some jokes landed and the Brock - venom dynamic was well done. Those are about the only redeeming parts of the film. The dialogue was bad. The plot was bad. The acting was bad. All other characters apart from Eddie and Venom were bad. I’m normally pretty easy to please but I did not enjoy this cringefest at all (neither did my friends who were quite hyped  to see it)

Much preferred justice league, even Spider-Man 3 - and those were not good films. 

Wondering if Sony marketing shills have invaded reddit or something. 


I’d probably give it a 4/10 or so it wasn’t the worst film ever! I just feel people are swinging the opposite way it’s almost like it’s gods gift to film
2018-10-08 19:30:21 Just watched venom today.. yeah the start is a bit slow but once tom gets infected, the movie just becomes enjoyable.. I'm pretty sure if you go watch this movie, you won't come out disappointed.. the end credit scene has me really hyped up for the sequel..
2018-10-08 17:32:51 Hmm I haven't seen Venom yet, although I'm thinking about it. But this makes me sad in a way, this pretty much means Marvel won't get the rights for Venom, right? I really want to see Tom Holland as Spider-Man with Venom. Rip.
2018-10-08 19:55:04 Not surprised.  *Venom* has a wider appeal.  I myself love musicals and movies about music, but *A Star Is Born* didn’t even appeal to me based off the trailers.

After seeing both, *A Star is Born* was the better movie, but man was I misled with those trailers.  I didn’t know it would be a darker piece with addiction, family problems, and the loss of love at its core.  If it was marketed as a darker film, I would have personally seen that one first.
2018-10-08 21:51:37 Wanted to say how much I appreciate Venom correctly using the San Francisco backdrop. The movie captures the actual feel of walking around sf in many moments and it was nice to finally see some good representation unlike AntMan/Wasp.
2018-10-08 22:33:30 Venom seems pretty exciting to watch despite the lousy reviews. But then again reviews shouldn't mean very much, at least not to me. 
2018-10-08 23:04:21 Good. Venom was solid. Not great but not bad at all. Going to see a Star is born sometime in the next few days. 
2018-10-09 11:28:29 Daaamnn. Venom's predictions were coming in at $50M. It will probably drop really hard on its second weekend, but a fantastic performance. Very happy for Tom Hardy.
2018-10-08 18:32:27 Venom is just Upgrade with a decent budget.
2018-10-08 17:10:07 Venom producers: 'So that means it was a good movie! Let's make some sequels.'
2018-10-08 21:31:09 A Star is Born was the best movie I saw all year. Just incredible acting, felt so raw and very personable given Cooper’s experience with alcoholism and Lady Gaga’s experience with breaking in the music industry. It showed the brutal aspect of being an addict in a way that just resonated with me, and the singing was phenomenal given the meaning behind each lyric that was sung. Cooper is an amazing director and I can’t wait to see what he does next.
2018-10-08 21:44:47 Venom is a hit for one reason: Tom Hardy.
2018-10-08 18:35:24 Not suprising Venom is #1 even tho the vocal minority in reddit said they won't watch the movie lmao
2018-10-08 16:15:25 
Venom was actually pretty solid! I'm pleasantly surprised
2018-10-08 18:33:56 I'd be interested in seeing week 2 numbers and how much venom declines.
2018-10-08 18:51:29 I do wonder if that record is going to be short-lived for Venom, especially with all the hype surrounding Halloween.
2018-10-08 19:54:34 Come on Carnage sequel!
2018-10-08 19:57:20 According to BoxOfficeMojo, only 36% of the overall audience was 25 years of age or older. Now that all the teenage boys have seen it, I can't imagine a scenario where the movie doesn't sink in the second weekend. Word of mouth and reviews are not exactly good. 
2018-10-08 20:34:35 I'm curious, why doesn't Sony simply introduce Miles Morales as Spiderman in its Spidey-verse and leave Tom Holland's Spiderman to the MCU? Win-win I'd say. Are there any legal issues with Marvel Studios which prevent that from happening?
2018-10-08 21:05:15 I dont care what the critics say, I loved the movie!
2018-10-08 21:34:21 Saw Venom- it's the same kind of movie as Wanted. It's not *good*, but it's extremely entertaining.
2018-10-08 21:57:40 Deadpool 2 made $3289 last week. That's like 200-300 tickets. Probably time to pull the plug.
2018-10-08 22:02:25 I'm still surprised it made so much. I drove by a mall on Sunday and the parking lot was totally full (Venom and Lady Gaga weekend!)

I'm not sure the explanation that Venom has been around since the 70s/80s explains it all, because many beloved franchises have been around since the 70s/80s and even earlier, and they still flop. 

My guess is that people were interested in another movie from the villain's side (much like Suicide Squad), and perhaps some *very* casual moviegoers who don't follow movie news even mistook this as a Disney/Marvel entry.
2018-10-08 22:14:33 Is Sonys spider-verse going to be another DCEU where they make average - mediocre movies but people keep watching them so they won't try to change?
2018-10-08 23:06:28 I just hope we'll get to see a sequel to Venom. It was surprisingly fun movie.
2018-10-08 23:31:48 The crowd I saw it with seemed to laugh a lot and enjoy the film. 

I honestly loved it and how the “Parasite” was developed.  
2018-10-09 00:14:54 A Star is Born is an excellent movie I hope it continues to do well.
2018-10-09 00:50:39 Venom was better than I thought tbh 
2018-10-09 05:25:28 I really enjoyed Venom actually. I don't understand the poor reviews. 
2018-10-09 06:27:37 **"Jump."**

*Ding*

**"Pussy!"**

Best part of the movie, hands down.
2018-10-08 18:44:47 Upvoted for Venom 2: Symbyeote Boogaloo!

2018-10-08 17:11:03 New rule:  Every primary star in a musical film should be required to play their own instruments and sing.  It just makes those kinds of films seem more genuine, knowing that they're really performing on camera
2018-10-08 18:27:33 Hurry for venom!
2018-10-08 21:38:08 [deleted]
2018-10-09 02:02:24 Fuck critics, Venom was fun.
2018-10-08 17:57:55 Christ now Sony is gonna go all out with their 3 tone messes
2018-10-08 18:44:46 I took my father to see The Predator.  He enjoyed it, and I did to a extent.  I really think the core skeleton of The Predator was a great movie, and they just kept adding on more story, more characters, more action pieces, etc.  The ending was incredibly lame as well, no one wants to see Mechs vs Predators.  
2018-10-08 18:57:00 It's no surprise that venom beat everything. It was the best marketed film last week. Would have surprised me even more if it bombed considering it's lack of competition. Wouldn't even call the next highest film star is Born competition as it isn't marketed to the same audience.
2018-10-08 20:35:40 I loved venom movie, i am a man who doesn't care about rotten tomatoes ratings!!
2018-10-08 21:05:58 How did suicide squad manage to get a b plus? That was one of the worst movies ive ever seen
2018-10-08 21:50:07 I feel like it got too much flack from critics. It wasn't a bad superhero movie, although it probably shouldn't have been a super hero movie. I was expecting some evilness from venom, but he was barely even an anti-hero.
2018-10-08 22:19:17 I really doubt you can use Gaga's lack of influence on Sin City 2's numbers to support any claim about her presence having an influence on ASIB's performance (or astroturfing Venom's for that matter). I would think her fans just saw the Sin City 2 appearance as a sort of "oh hey, Gaga's in a movie, neat, good for her" type of deal, without going to see it, knowing she had a very small part in it. ASIB on the other hand is a Gaga vehicle. The movie is all about her. It features her doing what she does on stage, not just vamping it up as a diner waitress with two lines and 30 seconds on camera. It also speaks to her whole message.
2018-10-08 22:25:19 The movie blew audiences away. Like a turd in the wind.
2018-10-08 23:31:39 I’m still bitter about them changing it from R to PG-13. But I’m hopeful that they release an uncut version for home media.
2018-10-08 23:56:39 I look forward to these posts every Monday 
2018-10-09 01:00:43 Holy crap, Jurassic World made $1.3 billion in 16 weeks from a $170 million budget. That's insane! 
2018-10-09 01:29:08 I can say my wife and I contributed to both Venom and A Star is Born this weekend. Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Venon, even though the villain was just not believable. My wife really enjoyed A Star is Born, I thought it was ok. The ending was unexpected for me. Wife cried freely through most of it.
2018-10-09 01:47:41 This is what happens when politics get so bad that everyone becomes desperate for a distraction. 
2018-10-09 02:15:47 So, i gotta ask: Is Venom as bad as it looks?
2018-10-09 03:39:21 I'm so happy about this since it means we will *finally* see my favorite comic character, Carnage, in a movie. I swear to God though if they make him a sympathetic character I'll be extremely upset. Carnage's appeal (imo) is that he's a true villain and has no redeeming qualities - he's chaotic, sociopathic, and is beyond saving. Let's hope they keep him that way.

2018-10-09 06:11:39 I actually loved Venom. Many scenes were rushed and the first 30 minutes or so were poorly written, but Tom as Eddie Brock/Venom was awesome. The relationship between Venom and Eddie was surprisingly hilarious. As a comic fan I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Overall 7/10
2018-10-09 08:10:34 Not much else for moviegoers to watch lol
2018-10-09 08:42:42 Idk why everyone "HATES" it, I liked the movie but would have LOVED it if they kept it Rated R. I knew they changed a bit and since it's Sony I kept my expections at a medium low and really enjoyed the movie. I also saw a lot of negative reviews saying Spider-man wasn't in it.... That made me want to get my head bitten off...
2018-10-10 22:50:20 Saw Venom last night it was pretty good. Hardy is really good as Brock. Also the interaction between him and Venom is interesting, and keeps you guessing.
2018-10-08 18:31:52 I saw Venom _because_ of the bad reviews. It's fun to watch a glorious trainwreck sometimes. More often than not I enjoy the film more because I went in with such low expectations.
2018-10-08 17:54:14 Venom had a bigger opening  than follow up MCU movie after Infinity War.

Sony execs must be ecstatic, you bet they weren't expecting a fantastic response like this.
2018-10-08 16:19:48 > Fans of the film were first put on edge when Sony finally decided that the film would get a PG-13 rating which angered star of the film Tom Hardy who's been vocal about the cuts from the R-rated version. 

The frustrating thing is that Venom as a character is not reliant on an R rating at all and I question how well people understand the character if this was seriously one of their biggest criticisms with the movie. Sure, if Carnage was involved then i'd say an R rating would have been beneficial for doing the character as much justice as possible, but without him the rating just wasn't needed and ultimately the decision to keep the movie PG-13 has paid off.

That said, whilst I have no problem with Venom succeeding, it's a shame that this makes Avi Arad look "right" after wanting to make a Venom movie for so long. That's all they had to do was wait a couple of years, establish the character in the MCU, give Marvel Studios control and they could have had a Venom movie that was even more of a success. But Sony probably wanted complete control and after like a decade of trying to make the movie, may not have wanted anyone else doing it. 

But whatever, the movie is a success on release and based on word of mouth so far it's looking like it will continue to be a success. The movie doesn't seem too bad and as Venom is my favourite villain i'll go and see it when it releases in my town. Just a shame that it could have been a much bigger hit with fans, critics and the studio if only Sony had the patience and competence to take their time with it. The fact the movie is going to do so well despite such a low critical rating to me shows how much potential they have wasted.

This all said I do hope we get the original R rated version on home release including any cut scenes. Apparently you can tell where the movies runtime got cut down and I want to see the best movie possible. If the filmmakers and crew set out to make one type of movie and it got cut down despite being finished, then everyone deserves to see it. Batman v Superman showed with the Ultimate Edition that hyping up an extended cut of a film can be very beneficial whether that be critically or just for the appeal of more footage, and if it's true Venom had like 40 minutes cut then that could be a very marketable extended cut for the studio.
2018-10-08 17:57:09 I hate that it doesn’t matter if a movie is bad any more they still will make a ton of money just by slapping something recognizable on it. 
2018-10-09 01:34:05 So glad Venom is doing great since everyone here wanted it to fail, because muh mcu!
2018-10-08 17:21:18 Venom succeeded because of the Stans.
2018-10-09 04:23:28 I know its petty but I'm glad Venom beat out Lady Gaga's movie after her fans tried to tank the movie with fake reviews. 
2018-10-08 18:00:20 Gotta admit, was definitely surprised by Venom. Was expecting it to be trash, but to me, it was at least twice as good Batman v Superman (in which has a slightly higher score). I definitely liked it more than Spider-Man 3 and AS2 by miles. 

That first half though. That was odd. I imagine they did this for budget reasons, but surely, there was a smarter way than having the first hour of the film be an entirely different film. 

Hopefully a higher budget for the more-than-likely to happen sequel will fix that a little. 
2018-10-08 20:12:59 I really liked Venom
2018-10-09 00:18:36 I love seeing this, ESPECIALLY when loads of people were absolutely shitting on it before it even came out.

Even if it's still not a great film according to reviews, let the people and fans go see it for themselves and make their own minds up. 

Seems like people kind of liked it anyways. 
2018-10-09 00:28:37 I'm still trying to figure out how people proclaim it to be an awful movie. It's a fictional superhero movie. It's made purely for entertainment purposes and it nailed it. 
2018-10-09 00:30:58 Yeah, venom was a good film. If you take the word of “professional movie critics” as a guideline you’re living in the dark ages. It’s a self-proclaimed group, largely biased, and you better hope you don’t relate to them. 

Get an idea of the plot, see the cast, and go see the film if those both interest you 
2018-10-08 16:14:30 Venom was pretty awesome. I saw it Last night. At 1.5hrs it was "short" and sweet.
2018-10-08 22:59:09 venom, being a silly but entertaining shlockfest deserves to beat a star is born, just another hollywood wankfest ala la la land.
2018-10-08 16:55:10 Venom was a terrible, terrible movie. BUT, it was entertaining and the only part that actually worked was the character, which really helps the film. The 2nd weekend drop is what I will be looking at as a sign of where the movie will go
2018-10-08 17:37:32 It's been a pretty tepid couple of years for movies.  I'm hoping things get better around *Halloween* and the late-year 'Oscar bait' season. 
2018-10-08 18:47:58 Well deserved! I don't get the hate for Venom, the performances were pretty good, the jokes were solid, and the story was fun. Yeah, the beginning was slow and the CGI could use work, but overall, it was a solid movie. 
2018-10-08 18:58:38 On one hand, this means the Venom/Spawn crossover Todd MacFarlane said he was down for is more likely to actually happen. On the other, Sony is going to think they're big shit now and be less likely to sell the Spider-Man rights back to Marvel. It feels like we're more likely to see Spawn and Venom in the same movie than we are Spider-Man and Venom and that's just... bizarre.
2018-10-08 19:44:28 The reason why venom did so well is because people like venom. Sure the movie probably sucks, but I didn't notice any of the shitty parts bc I just really liked Venom as a kid. I had to watch it twice. Seeing the animations for venom's abilities and transformation that Spiderman 3 couldn't do, it was way too awesome. 
2018-10-08 20:01:31 Just remember, Spider-Man 3 was the 3rd highest grossing movie in 2007 and for some reason people hated it.
2018-10-08 20:57:13 Venom was such a good film don’t @ me. 
2018-10-08 21:38:24 Venom was the best Buddy Cop movie ive seen this decade. Fight me
2018-10-08 21:42:02 I think the reason why people went to see Venom in mass is because they were expecting a giant shit-show. It currently has a 35 on metacritic which compared to The Amazing Spider-Man 2's 53 made it seem like it was going be the worst Marvel movie ever. But when people realized it's pretty good dumb fun the Venom train lost its breaks
2018-10-08 23:32:15 Well there are literally no other movies out to go see right now
2018-10-09 00:08:54 Venoms plot was bad don’t @ me
2018-10-09 01:00:13 I must be easily amused because it was a good movie to watch beginning to end, some serious tones some funny jokes to lighten the mood. It's now one of my favorites. I dont get all the hate for this movie.
2018-10-09 01:05:43 Venom is a cool, badass, light movie which entertains. I dont get critics/people hating on this, i mean just chill out and enjoy ^^
2018-10-09 01:09:55 I enjoyed Venom.
2018-10-09 01:26:09 Im honestky shocked at Venom.

So long as they didn't spend a lot on it, like 50 million or less than 100, then it's a smash win. 

2018-10-09 01:29:03 I feel like Venom is going to have the same life as The Amazing Spider-Man: people will line up to defend it, but the moment Marvel does their own version, those same people will either shut up or act like they always hated the Sony one. 
2018-10-09 04:31:35 I heard venom was bad though...
2018-10-09 06:57:27 Alright who has seen this movie was it really as bad as the reviews say? 
2018-10-08 17:26:47 Went in with low expectations, but left pleasantly surprised(not a die hard Venom fan). It wasn’t a great movie, but I still found it enjoyable. The villains, story, writing and acting(some) were weak, but the Eddie/Venom banter and action made up for it. Wish it went with the R-rating. 
2018-10-08 19:16:57 I thought Venom was better than Black Panther and Ant-Man this year. Still put it behind Avengers. 
2018-10-08 21:42:28 Everyone so amazed about how venom did. Super hero movies always do this first weekend. Watch it have a 60 percent drop next week and then make less than solo overall.
2018-10-08 22:16:35 But I thought Venom was gonna flop because there was no Spiderman in it?
2018-10-08 18:26:02 Now we just need a R-rated  "Venom vs Carnage movie"...(Carnage wont work with a PG13). 
2018-10-08 19:03:51 Well deserved for A Star is Born.

Welp, I hope you guys are happy when we get Mobius the Vampire, Kraven the Hunter, Black Cat, and Silver Sable solo movies. I see a strange defense force on the Internet that reminded me of Suicide Squad with how Venom wasn't a bad movie and that critics are paid off/they don't like fun movies. Sometimes I feel like there's a bit of political motivation to hate on Disney and Marvel because of the accusation that they're run by "evil liberals and SJWs."
2018-10-08 18:22:45 I’ve noticed a trend that the majority of people still shit talking Venom haven’t seen it, people are just determined to hate it. 

I saw it with friends and all 6 of us enjoyed it. I’d give it a B letter grade. I think the critics gave it ratings they thought would play to their readers liking because critics are shady and untrustworthy, and this explains the huge gap between user rating and critic rating. 

I also think complaining about it not being rated R is the dumbest complaint. It’s a stand in for people without substance because I’ve literally never seen anyone explain how rated R would make it better. It’s not like you need to be 17 to buy the source material, and he’s evil but not all that graphic. Having seen the movie I can’t really say of anywhere that had it been rated R it would have upped the movie quality. R makes sense for Deadpool when you look at the source material but Venoms source isn’t quite the same. 
2018-10-08 17:29:51 Is anyone going to talk about Kin? Never heard anything about it and that closing is terrible. What was the reason for it’s failure?
2018-10-08 18:08:44 Is it good though?
2018-10-08 18:15:15 Uh what?
2018-10-08 18:36:03 4th remake of “a star
2018-10-08 18:36:33 30 million budget. Dang
2018-10-08 18:42:54 Ummmm....how? I'm just real confused by this.
2018-10-08 18:43:18 How
2018-10-08 18:43:54 The best way I can describe Venom is that it's a very Sony take on a comic book movie. It's definitely not a Marvel Studios movie and it feels a lot like the superhero movies from 15-20 years ago.
2018-10-08 19:02:09 Venom wasn't great but it wasn't bad, either.   Felt a little dated but I felt it was still a fun movie.
2018-10-08 19:03:31 Is the movie actually good?
2018-10-08 19:06:54 Oh so the fans didn't have to hate each other and both movies did fine?  Wow crazy
2018-10-08 19:08:04 This movie was so weird in that it felt good and bad at the same time. Excited for a sequel
2018-10-08 19:14:16 Great. Now there will be a sequel and Sony will never learn what a shitty movie is
2018-10-08 19:16:25 Looks like we might get that She-Venom spin off the Actress for Anne wants to do. She said Sony would consider making it if Venom was a success.
2018-10-08 19:17:03 "On Cinemascore Venom scored a B+ rating which puts it at the same rating as Spider-Man 3 (which also featured Venom), Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Suicide Squad."

&#x200B;

That's actually hilarious. I don't give much credence to movie review formulas / websites anyway, but any metric that gives those films only a step down from an "A" rating is outrageously off base. 
2018-10-08 19:37:15 The Venom Cinematic Universe has been funded by "dude wouldn't it be hilarious if we went to go see venom?"
2018-10-08 19:38:51 Venom was awesome! Yes the beginning was kinda rushed but it went straight to action and kept it rolling. Cool fight scenes. Would recommend. 
2018-10-08 19:42:19 I actually really enjoyed Venom. 

*ducks thrown tomato*
2018-10-08 19:47:56 I expected Venom to do good in the box office for the first week. I think it'll under-perform compared to expectations for the second week.
2018-10-08 20:14:25 Lol so much spite for a Star is Born
2018-10-08 20:20:57 I was disappointed with Venom too, surprised it did this well.
2018-10-08 20:25:30 A lot of bitching about Sony, but people went out and gave them money. Oh well.
2018-10-08 20:27:21 I'm confused. Last night I read the Rotten Tomato reviews, as I was curious how Venom recieved a 31% rating on that website. Every single staff written review made the movie out to be god awful. So where is the disconnect?
2018-10-08 20:35:14 Saw both movies yesterday. Both were amazing. 
2018-10-08 20:47:48 I really enjoyed Venom. It reminded me of a "pre-MCU" superhero movie. I feel like the advertising didn't really explain the tone of the movie - but if they did I don't think it would have been as successful. It has a really specific tone that you can't convey in a 20 second commercial.  
2018-10-08 20:47:54 Funniest movie of the past 5 years 
2018-10-08 20:51:45 Tom Hardy was by far the best part about Venom in an other wise poor movie. 
2018-10-08 20:55:50 I haven’t seen venom yet, but I have a feeling that it’s gonna he another Batman V Superman story. Critics hate it, fans are split on hating or liking it, it did well on its first weekend and it’s gonna have a massive drop off in its second weekend 
2018-10-08 21:08:00 >	Despite a rocky road to release the strange off-brand start to the Sony Marvel Spider-man Without Spider-Man Cinematic Universe know as Venom opened to an incredible $80M at #1.

Could I maybe persuade you to put a comma in there? 
2018-10-08 21:09:00 Is venom a good bad movie?
2018-10-08 21:09:50 I liked it, Hardy gave a lot of depth to a shallow script. I'm curious to see the parts the got cut out that Hardy liked. If they're smart they'll forgo the directors cut and put in a Hardy's cut. 
2018-10-08 21:11:45 I find it weird how people think if Venom would've failed they would've let Marvel have a go at him.

Venom and this Spider-less Universe being a failure would've resulted in the exact opposite scenario. They would've taken Spidey back instead.

Sony knows that Spidey is 100% a money maker. Right now they're splitting that money with Marvel.

Venom being a financial failure would've told them that they need Spiderman to make them money. 
2018-10-08 21:16:02 never expected the movie to live up to the hype ... BUT still I watched VENOM only for TOM HARDY  ....  there goes some of my contribution to that box-office..
2018-10-08 21:19:53 I’ve said this before and I’ll continue saying it, bring back Garfield and continue with the Amazing Spider-Man alongside Venom. 
2018-10-08 21:27:12 I was obsessed with the venom character when I was 12 or so. I wish this movie had come out like 15 or 20 years ago.
2018-10-08 21:27:15 The movie had a huge advertising budget. All I've been seeing for weeks is ads for venom... 
2018-10-08 21:28:20 I went to the movies 3 times last week 
2018-10-08 21:35:20 But was Venom good though? 
2018-10-08 21:35:47 I wish they would use number of tickets vs money. The total gross will always go up year after year just due to inflation. And you can't tell if the movie is universally  popular or just popular in places with hight ticket prices 
2018-10-08 21:36:17 Congrats Sony for making money on Venom.

Now give us the goddamn unrated directors cut
2018-10-08 21:41:15 *4th remake of A Star Is Born. ‘37, ‘54 and 1976.
2018-10-08 21:52:45 I reckon Venom was a one and done thing. As much as I enjoyed it. (A solid 7/10) the only thing I'd care for is a sequel. Any other film ideas like a Kraven the Hunter, Black Cat or Morbius the Living Vampire film will die a death. 
2018-10-08 22:03:46 I'm sad that I'm not excited about this movie :( even tho I haven't watched it, I really feel like they blew it and missed the mark by not making it rated R, especially being a stand alone movie..
2018-10-08 22:05:38 It's awesome we will get shitty superhero films until we die because people just refuse not to go see them. /s
2018-10-08 22:06:33 What? I thought that it would be a massive flop.
2018-10-08 22:18:03 All credit due to Tom Hardy. The writing for this movie was really bad. Like not good. And everyone except for Hardy played it completely straight which made it all fall flat. But Hardy really elevated the material he was given and made  it really fun and likable.
2018-10-08 22:47:41 Is venom any good? Rt gives it low ratings
2018-10-08 22:50:12 It exceeded expectations.  Like a turd in the wind. 
2018-10-08 23:07:52 Hope no one was expecting a third MCU Spider-Man movie cause that's not happening now.
2018-10-08 23:42:37 I wanted to see it, then read the reviews and thought, maybe not.
But I love going to movies and had looked forward to this. 
Slow start, but well worth it. Let’s make movies fun again!
2018-10-09 00:15:58 **The Happytime Murders** bombed big time. Wonder whether it will be a while until we see another Melissa Mccarthy film.
2018-10-09 01:49:09 I'm really suprised venom did this well, recently a trend of slowed sales follows quality concerns or disinterest on the internet, perhaps lowered discourse worked In It's favor with the general public. 
2018-10-09 01:53:12 So piracy isn't killing the movie industry?
2018-10-09 01:55:20 Why have so many people seen this movie? Without the Spider-Man connection I feel like I'd walk out of the movie
2018-10-09 02:00:28 That was exactly my opinion of the movie - bad/inconsistent writing, but extremely entertaining. I liked it enough that I plan to go see it again in the cinema at least once or twice. I had a lot of fun, so much so that I didn't think to pick apart the plot holes until afterward (and boy are there a lot of those)
2018-10-09 02:11:59 Did NOT expect that. Is it any good?
2018-10-09 02:12:20 So, at venom's success and the potential of Spider-Man rights shenanigans, can someone catch me up on where exactly the whole rights thing is regarding Spidey? Sony can still do whatever they want, right? Or did Marvel make it so Spidey is leased to them and Sony can't touch without permission?

2018-10-09 02:23:01 How in the hell did Venom manage to come even remotely close to Justice League opening weekend BO? Just... wow. Sony execs finally have another win on their hands after WW.
2018-10-09 02:36:46 I thought people hated venom lots off you tubers and people on twitter hate it
2018-10-09 03:09:56 I know this movie hasn’t even been released yet, but what do you guys think of the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse movie coming out? 
2018-10-09 03:21:34 So just finished seeing a house with a clock in it's walls.i gotta say im pleasantly satisfied with what I got on screen.  Blanchett and Black bounced off each other fairly well and while the reviews aren't bad by any means, I feel like its ever so slightly underrated.

That said can't wait to go see venom in the next few weeks.
2018-10-09 03:30:49 Venom had potential, a lot, but it sucked. It was a quick money grab. How cheesy is it that the dude playing carnage says that he's going to be carnage..lol they should have had woody harrison in a video saying * hey guys just thought I would let know I'm playing carnage in the next movie * and when venom just said to riot, no I like earth I want to stay. Shit sucked honestly it's a bad name for good superhero movies with at least a hint of quality. The director can kiss my ass. Aside from the cgi this movie almost seems fan made to me. 
2018-10-09 04:04:54 Great film, great actors, great venom terrible movie. Like playing GTA online. Yea it's great but it's also shit. Would watch again tho
2018-10-09 04:22:21 September was an incredibly slow month for movies, so the fact that people are coming out now is no surprise.
2018-10-09 04:25:08 Sucks cus i bought so many sony calls expecting this movie to make it run... nope, sony keeps dropping in price
2018-10-09 04:46:25 Looking forward to watching Venom in a week or 2.

But let's not celebrate yet.

It could be wildly front loaded and may end up tanking 2nd weekend.

I'm hoping it does well, as more Spidey verse movies are welcome...I just hope they take care and make them better.
2018-10-09 05:19:42 The weird thing to me is that The last time Venom showed up he was so bad he derailed the Spider-Man franchise the first time around.  Logic dictates that a crappy Venom in his own movie should be even worse.  Now I want to watch to figure out what’s going on.  (I think I just figured out why it’s doin well)
2018-10-09 05:25:17 This doesn't add up
2018-10-09 05:40:36 Nothing about JESA? Is it not good? 
2018-10-09 06:05:24 Free Solo was incredible. Glad to see it's so successful for a small indie documentary. 

You definitely don't need to be a climber to enjoy it, but oh man, if you've ever been rock climbing you will appreciate this.
2018-10-09 06:50:58 Venom would be so badass if it were rated R
2018-10-09 07:18:14 Is this the first time the same cinematographer has shot the #1 and #2 film with Matthew Libatique doing both?
2018-10-09 08:58:25 I want it!! Wooooo
2018-10-09 16:26:47 Antman did not make a billion dollars in box office despite being a MCU movie.
2018-10-09 17:26:51 >the strange off-brand start to the Sony Marvel Spider-man Without Spider-Man Cinematic Universe

The SMSWSCU. it's official. that's what I'm calling it.
2018-10-09 22:47:17 For those of you that have seen Venom is there a button scene I should stick around for?
2018-10-10 01:09:52 Thanks to Sinemia, I have seen all.  Wow, that's a lot of movies
2018-10-13 12:22:49 You can watch venom here. [Venom Full Movie](https://themoviesworldonline.blogspot.com/) 
2018-10-17 04:08:24 Venom was not that good tbh.
2018-10-18 04:32:44 I loved venom. It was entertaining and fun to watch. That's all I care about
2018-10-20 07:39:30 I love how venom looks and how funny his dialogue can be.


I’m also curious how he know sharif organs in the human body since he somehow knew about lungs eyes and the other things which is strange for an alien life form to know
2018-10-31 05:08:38 My brother and I went to see it Sunday. I thought it was alright, and I did a post about it on my blog.

https://theuncannyfox.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/i-just-saw-venom/
2018-10-08 19:13:39 [deleted]
2018-10-08 17:28:37 Ugh, that means Sony is gonna double down on their shitty Spider-man movies. Great.
2018-10-08 20:09:19 I don't care about either movie, but I love the fact that Venom outsold A Star is Born, since Lady Gaga fans tried to sabotage Venom.
2018-10-08 21:26:44 Venom was better than Spiderman homecoming. Fuck the haters. 
2018-10-08 17:42:48 YES! YES! YES!

Contrary to the critics, Venom was not a disgraceful film.
Yes there are issues with it but nothing compared to say Catwoman or Suicide Squad.

The sequel HAS to be 18 now, surely.
2018-10-08 20:26:57 Did anyone else think "A Star is Born" was dreadful?

I love Bradley Cooper as much as the next guy but I thought the movie was terrible...  Went with the GF Saturday night and we left wondering what we saw.

The jumps forward in story without context were really killing me.  That said, I've never seen the original either but won't likely be rushing to do so anytime soon. :-/
2018-10-08 18:15:53 It looks like that Twitter campaign which tried to pump up viewers for A Star Is Born by criticizing Venom was a failure. Venom had ~4x worldwide sales.  
2018-10-08 18:43:57 Can we just say Venom > DC Universe? 
2018-10-08 18:44:08 The critics and the internet are shitting on it but everyone I know who has already seen it claims it was solid.
2018-10-08 20:11:01 Problem apart from sloppy writing was I think Tom Hardy. I think he just played himself and it didn't really quite work. All the time I was thinking why is Tom Hardy in this movie. Not a character but actually Tom Hardy. Bad casting imo. 
2018-10-08 20:14:37 Hate to point this out wasn't ragnerok released at the end of October and opened to 500m? Just saying
2018-10-08 20:18:39 A Star is Born is the best movie related music I’ve ever seen
2018-10-08 22:01:48 I loved Venom. I took my stepson to see it for his birthday. Hope they make a sequel soon. Now that we know the entire backstory of venom a sequel would have a lot more action. The huge fight at the end makes you forget the slow origin parts. 
2018-10-08 22:15:47 Who the hell writes this shit? I saw A Star is Born last night and the theatre was full of young people, lots of them men. It's not for old people, and it's not for women and gay men. It's seriously a great film and you shouldn't avoid it for fear of looking less masculine.
2018-10-08 22:20:28 Venom was fine. It felt like every other origin movie. Hopefully the sequel will be the movie we all are dying for. But it’s not as terrible as everyone says. 
2018-10-08 23:36:37 The bad press didn't make Venom succeed as implied by the article.

Its just that we are the minority, the rest of the world has no clue about all the production issues of the movie nor has the taste to see the trailer and immediately go "wtf is a sym-BYE-ote?" or "why is Tom Hardy speaking like he is retarded?".

In summary, the common denominator doesn't care. A new movie came out and they will go see it regardless of how bad it is.
2018-10-09 02:52:17 I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF COMIC BOOK BULLSHIT.


2018-10-09 02:57:03 Venom got bad "critic" reviews because it didn't feature a woman in the lead role or gay character. 

It got good viewer ratings because no one really cares about any of that, they just want to be entertained.  
2018-10-08 17:27:37 Glad it was a hit in the box office. Now lets hope Carnage gets an R 18 movie.
2018-10-08 18:56:18 “(though plenty of young gay men and women were in my theater)”

Damn i’m straight and thought that movie seemed good... guess I’m screeed now
2018-10-08 19:09:01 I never knew much about Venom. As a kid I was afraid of it and never got into it.

The movie was an excellent introduction and I'd love to see more. Not sure why it go so much hate from reviewers
2018-10-08 19:18:50 People are really treating everyone outside of Reddit as mindless dunces in this thread and it's disheartening, but expected. 
2018-10-08 19:24:40 Bla bla bla.
2018-10-08 19:52:42 I just hope they take the money and make venom 2 with carnage. 

And make it rated R 
2018-10-08 19:56:21 venom reminded me of mission impossible 3 or 4:

-the trailer was better than the movie
2018-10-08 21:49:06 So it's gonna be like the Transformers movies and Suicide Squad; a critical failure but a commercial hit.
2018-10-08 22:43:16 Venom was fucking awesome.  Sure, it had flaws like some weak acting here and there and some stereotypical villains and characters, but overall it was great.  Venom bit some dude's head off.  What more do you need?
2018-10-08 23:28:32 I must be alone here, but I loved Venom from start to finish. Slow burner, but it delivers all the fun I could have wanted out of a film I don't know any of the source material for.
2018-10-09 00:05:56 \*\*\* I WANT TO SEE VENOM BUT GOT BABIES!!! \*\*\*

I haven't been able to go to a movie theatre for about a good three years.
2018-10-09 00:18:39 Venom is going to turn into another Trasformers franchise. Critics hate the movie but its still going to make enough for a sequel that will probably be worse 
2018-10-09 00:20:59 I enjoyed venom. I feel like people dive to much into relating the story hard into the comics. It is its own story, just let it be that and enjoy it if you enjoy it. Dont if you dont. 
2018-10-09 00:54:49 Great performances!  
2018-10-09 01:24:15 Well that’s depressing. 
2018-10-09 01:30:27 I browsed a lot of whiny reviews about this movie.  It's probably awesome.
2018-10-09 01:58:04 Venom was great
2018-10-09 02:47:41 Lotta “losers on their planet” hate venom everywhere I see. I was almost worried but they absolutely nailed it 10/10.
2018-10-09 02:52:23 Shit movie and it still does this? Smh
2018-10-09 03:37:30 I want to go see a movie with the bros. This is the only bro movie out right now. 
2018-10-09 05:34:29 Hmmmm yknow what else probably helped was the wave of censorship towards the piss poor reviews Venom got
2018-10-08 18:18:07 I'm just disappointed I didn't get another spider man origin story. I'm not sure I really understand the story yet. Does Ben die or is it just a metaphor for how dull and repetitive superhero movies are? 
2018-10-08 23:18:48 One of the worst superhero movies I have seen in my life. Absolutely terrible CGI, terrible actors and complete absence of violence from Venom (i get its pg-13). 

Boring movie for little kids, they showed the best scenes in the trailer including the last scene in the movie. 

Worse than Ant Man and the Wasp.
2018-10-08 21:50:23 Venom was kinda bad.

Edit : Okay, it was really bad.
2018-10-08 16:22:35 Awww... that's nice 
2018-10-08 21:49:10 Makes me think those idiotic reviewers are almost completely worthless... but I should continue to let Hollywood tell me what’s good. 
2018-10-08 23:34:50 Saw both this weekend.  Thought Star was horrible, Venom was good.  Even my GF did not like Star, and she was why we went. 
2018-10-09 01:37:16 Venom was soooo BBBOOORRRRIIINNNGGG
2018-10-08 16:57:51 So the bad reviews had no impact on Venom's box office? I guess I'm the only one waiting for the home release
2018-10-08 16:22:01 I am so freaking happy Venom made bank!!!! Bring on a sequel and add him to the MCU!

editL what a bunch of haters in this thread. I loved the movie, it was a very fun ride. I really fell sorry if you didn't have fun. but I did and a ton of people did since it already made it's budget back. 
2018-10-08 17:11:41 [deleted]
2018-10-08 18:10:17 Those are some wild numbers, considering it was nearly impossible to get tickets to see A Star is Born this weekend, yet most all of Venom's screenings had open seats available. 
2018-10-08 19:17:27 God damnit people... Stop giving Sony money. 
2018-10-08 19:33:36 Common theme I'm hearing for Venom is people expected a dumpster fire. Instead they got a slightly below average film and that makes them love it. Speaks volumes to the kind of quality Sony is putting out with Spidey properties. I opted for a Star Is Born this weekend, my wife is still talking about it and it still has her in her feelings. I expect it to have great legs. There's something about seeing an actor like Cooper lose themselves completely in a role and manage to tell a great story as well.
2018-10-08 21:10:49 A Star is Born can smd
2018-10-08 23:02:30 Venom was terrible. I even showed up kinda tipsy..... Still terrible. 
2018-10-08 23:40:28 And Venom sucked.
2018-10-09 00:05:30 [deleted]
2018-10-09 00:20:03 Im sorry but this movie was great
2018-10-08 19:33:27 People are so fucking stupid for not realizing how shitty Venom is just from the trailers. Sony doesnt deserve the money for such a pathetic dogshit movie.
2018-10-08 18:27:48 ***A Star is Born (2018) (cont.) -*** *I got nothing to say here, I just wanted to take another look at ya. :\]*

Heh.

Also, I saw Venom, ASIB, and Free Solo this weekend. Gotta say, Venom was the biggest surprise, but Free Solo was definitely the most gripping. Interesting insight into Alex too. ASIB was fine.
2018-10-08 18:44:32 People will literally watch anything. So sad
2018-10-08 20:29:22 And critics have been exposed yet again....
2018-10-08 17:21:46 I loved Venom. While not the greatest movies, it was very entertaining. I will probably go see it again. I really want a sequel. As for A Star is Born, it was so boring and the person I went with said the same thing. There was no reason that the movie needed to be over 2 hours. I was often checking the time hoping it would be over soon. I really enjoyed the acting but it was just not engaging.
2018-10-08 22:27:47 Venom was so awful. Lol
2018-10-09 01:21:11 That movie looked like shit. Jesus people are dumb and will go see anything with a big enough band wagon.
2018-10-09 01:29:23 Screw escapism. Go watch Fahrenheit 11/9. That’s all that matters
2018-10-08 18:54:26 Venom making as much money as it has, just shows how smart consumers are.
2018-10-08 19:24:14 lol. no idea why someone would pay money to watch Venom
2018-10-08 19:53:43 Yawn who gives a shit
2018-10-08 20:18:08 Just another clue that movie critics are terrible at what they do and are completely out of touch.
2018-10-08 20:23:59 cant believe people actually liked tom hardy in this. the dialogue between venom and eddie was cheesy, all of eddies lines seemed random and out of place, and dont get me started on the way he talks.
2018-10-09 00:36:22 Meanwhile venom has a 35 on RT.
2018-10-09 01:32:51 So is everyone just going to ignore that this crap backstory how venom got to Brock doesn't even superficially resemble the actual backstory of venom? And that Brock actually had a violent axe to grind with spidey and wasn't at all this hey-venom-be-good-now good guy? Not that the actual backstory was particularly strong, but this yuppy asshole rocket boy backstory is pretty shit.

Enjoyable movie otherwise. 
2018-10-09 06:30:12 Too bad venom sucked 
2018-10-08 18:15:59 So I guess Marvel will have to reconsider letting Venom into this universe. The man who jumped into a lobster tank.
2018-10-08 18:23:10 I saw a clip of The Hate You Give and can't wait to see that movie!
2018-10-08 19:00:29 News next year. Venom to be introduced into the MCU in the next Spider-Man film. 
2018-10-08 19:13:14 So...Venom didn't suck? 
2018-10-08 19:47:58 It doesnt matter now, all reviews are out on venom and it's not good at all. The movie is painfully average at best. Real shame. Even Tom hardy said himself in a interview with rob from comicsexplained that his favorite scenes were all cut from the film, 40 minutes of it. The numbers will tank this week for sure.
2018-10-08 19:52:29 Honestly,this has to be the most pretentious sub on reddit...
2018-10-08 19:58:07 Hearing the ending was good makes me wish I didn’t walk out after an hour of watching this piece of crap.
2018-10-08 20:01:38 Am I the only one that hates the Eminem title track?
2018-10-08 20:08:23 Wait I just noticed there’s no The Greatest Showman on Films on Follow List anymore 
2018-10-08 20:38:55 Venom could’ve been a great movie if it was rated R. 
2018-10-08 20:47:29 I watched both this weekend.  A Star is Born was Ok.  Pretty much the same story as the first and second one.  Venom was much better than expected.  I've seen it twice already.
2018-10-08 21:05:09 [https://www.reddit.com/user/CryptoExtract/comments/9mgnxw/cryptotab\_browser\_lightweight\_fast\_and\_ready\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/user/CryptoExtract/comments/9mgnxw/cryptotab_browser_lightweight_fast_and_ready_to/)
2018-10-08 21:08:20 There wasn’t exactly much in the way of competition...
2018-10-08 22:21:00 That is because there is goddamned nothing else in theaters for months. Don't get me wrong, I think it'll be great and I'm excited to see it, but the box office has no competition. It's been a shit year for movies. I think there was a month straight where the only action/adventure movie in theaters was Mission Impossible.
2018-10-08 22:30:06 Because venom reviews by all mostly  negative and its not very good, word of mouth will cause a steep drop off with in the week and I'd be amazed if it makes anything like spiderman.  I can't imagine a sequel either though maybe a Spiderman cross over.
2018-10-08 22:47:11 A Star is Born was great. One of my favorites this year. Venom was good too, but kinda was held back by the whole vibe being like a movie that would've come out 10 years ago and will probably be getting overplayed on FX in a few years with lots of commercial breaks.

2018-10-09 00:52:14 I remember when stuff like this mattered to me...miss those days.
2018-10-09 01:43:22 It might have made money but from everything ive heard it was a horrible movie 
2018-10-09 03:28:50 This sucks.  Get used to your PG-13 superhero movies sigh...
2018-10-09 22:52:36 venom is a pretty bad movie, but its bad in such a uniquely goofy way that the movie is almost saved because of it.
2018-10-08 18:47:32 Sigh, it was such a terrible movie.
2018-10-08 19:19:05 Such a shame, Venom is such garbage nobody should have seen this movie
2018-10-08 20:14:28 Hats off to the 8 MCU loyalists who boycotted Venom.
2018-10-08 20:43:29 A star was born was a much better movie. 
2018-10-08 22:46:56 Old farts who greenlight films don't get it. Antiheros like deadpool and cool villians like venom and carnage are what kids who grew up reading comics enjoyed.. I never really properly enjoyed wolverine until Logan when they finally made it r rated as all xmen movies with him should have been. If hollywood would stop worrying about plastic mass appeal and make faithful representations of badass characters the money takes care of itself.
2018-10-09 00:37:16 Venom does not deserve that
2018-10-08 18:55:20 Who here paid to see Venom, and why would you do that you silly person.
2018-10-08 18:39:15 Venom was cringe worse then predator.
2018-10-08 18:53:35 Fuck I really wanted venom to fail. Gotta show the studios that they can't make shit and expect it to make money, but I guess they can. Oh well
2018-10-08 23:03:24 A Star is Born was bad, and Bradley Cooper should feel bad. [177 minutes of going nowhere until he hangs himself because her manager doesn't like him.](#spoiler) It meanders from conflict to conflict between Gaga and Cooper, but like a homebuyer at an open house, the film just pokes its head in each room to look around, then moves on to the next one. So much of it made no sense, so much of it was left unresolved, and all the cutesy romantic moments between Gaga and Cooper are not enough to make up for that. I spent the whole film waiting for something. [Copper's jealousy over her growing fame? A food fight will fix that! Now he's couching her in the studio! Wow, a grammy nomination? Here comes some more of that jealousy, OH SHES UGLY! HERE COMES THE DRAMA! Wait, they're fine because he didn't drink that day he went to apologize, but he can't watch rehearsal! That'll teach him! His alcoholism made him disappear for... a day? A night? However long it was until he showed up in token wise blackman Dave Chappelle's yard. She then travels to Memphis, which she said she wouldn't, gives him an ultimatum, only to ACCEPT HIS PROPOSAL WITH A TWISTED QUITAR STRING FOR A RING IN A STRANGERS HOUSE](#spoiler)
2018-10-08 19:38:40 MCU fanboyes must be dying inside, their slander didn't work out well lol
2018-10-08 20:01:26 Was kinda hoping it would bomb, it fucking sucks. #turdinthewind
2018-10-08 20:54:22 It did not much competition to be honest
2018-10-08 21:03:47 Yet the movie sucks massive dick
2018-10-08 21:27:22 I can't believe I live in a world where a mangled Venom movie and Lady Gaga are top of the week in the box office and yet here we are... 
2018-10-08 21:28:51 How on Earth did Venom do so well? It looks absolutely awful. 
2018-10-09 01:26:28 Why is the final dollar value being used? A better representation of success would be total tickets sold. Theater prices vary too much from location to location and even within a few years the difference is noticeable. Actual ticket sales would be a closer representation of popularity, especially sales after opening weekend.
2018-10-08 17:54:03 Is it really massive, though? 80 million isn't really a huge number domestically for a movie with a $100M+ budget. Biggest in October is a qualifier, but October isn't really blockbuster season, so I doubt the competition was too stiff here. If you ranked it with MCU movies it's between Dr. Strange and Ant Man 2.
2018-10-08 23:06:27 Venom is a hot garbage movie!
2018-10-09 01:17:58 Shame that the film was shit
2018-10-08 21:07:39 It might also smash the 2nd weekend drop-off record once word of mouth gets around about how absolutely terrible it is.
2018-10-09 01:56:14 Too bad it got horrible reviews or else maybe I would've watched it 
2018-10-09 03:32:38 Venom was so bad
2018-10-08 16:17:54 I strongly believe that marvel are making a good approach with movies like deadpool and venom
2018-10-08 20:45:55 How can such a shitty made film grab that much money, holy shit, I am actually sad about how much people love to eat shit and smile
2018-10-08 20:32:55 Ppl saw a movie with a trash panda and some weird girl with a meat dress
2018-09-17 23:46:30 This will be on FX in no time
2018-09-17 23:41:25 Everything about this movie has this insanely bland corporate glaze over it. It's truly bizarre 
2018-09-18 04:02:42 Anybody want to place bets on the RT score after the dust settles? 

I'm gonna say...Critics: 32%; Users: 48%.

Edit: Interesting outcome...currently sitting at Critics: 29%; Users: 89%. 

I'm not sure if this is because the user reviews are flooded with venom fanboys, or if it might actually be worth watching? 
2018-09-18 01:42:39 The rocket in the poster would seem to support the leaked plot outline that surfaced a few days ago. 
2018-09-17 22:57:30 The whole esthetic around this movie is so late 90’s early  2000. If it works it could be its secret weapon but if it doesn’t it will sink it even lower.
2018-09-18 01:48:15 They did hold a Art/design contest for fans to create promotional pieces for the film earlier this month. So it may be possible.

I wanted to send in some work but the fine print on the rules of the contest is that they can use your artwork for whatever they want even if not chosen as a winner. 
2018-09-18 10:46:59 That's a 35% movie on Rotten Tomatoes right there. 
2018-09-17 23:02:42 This movie will be like a turd in the wind.
2018-09-18 01:19:36 get the rotten tomatoes ready boys!
2018-09-17 23:20:37 Looks fan-made
2018-09-18 00:50:52 What's up with Tom Hardy's head?
2018-09-17 23:11:57 This looks bad. Every time Sony releases a new picture, poster, or trailer it looks worse. The CGI looks terrible. Not only are practical effects better than CGI, they didn't even use *good* CGI. It looks like **Great-Value** CGI. The dialogue in the trailer is cringe worthy. You can't understand every third word from Tom mush-mouth Hardy. His "accent" is awful. It's rated pg-13 not R.

A few years ago when Sony Pictures emails were hacked and we read the dialogue between the producers we learned everything we needed to know about how this company is run. The out-of-touch board members that own Sony Pictures have the producers by their balls. They keep throwing the same "kids like emojis and parkour right? Let's incorporate that into our movie somehow" shit. At this point, I fully expect Venom to start playing Fortnite at some point during the movie. I'm so sad that Sony owns the rights to my favorite Marvel villain.
2018-09-18 02:25:31 Spawn 2:  Electric Boogaloo looks good
2018-09-18 06:01:38 This is a super busy poster.  
2018-09-17 23:07:41 I hope this movie fails so MCU could get the rights back. 
2018-09-17 23:45:33 While I have little faith in the movie, so far, I really hope it succeeds so I can FINALLY see Carnage on screen. Venom is cool and all, but Carnage is my favorite symbiote in Spiderman. 
2018-09-18 05:03:37 Straight to DVD
2018-09-17 23:12:10 I feel like I'm one of the 5 people on the entire planet who is cautiously excited for this. I am skeptical due to the clunky dialogue in the trailers and Sony's track record but there are a lot of talented people involved in this and Venom himself looks spot-on aside from the chest. We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.
2018-09-18 05:50:03 Too many red flags for this film
2018-09-18 02:42:50 Three terrific actors relegated to paychecks. 
2018-09-18 05:27:56 This movie is gonna be so shitty
2018-09-17 23:47:15 It looks like it was made ten years ago by a fan who was like "wow guys imagine a Venom movie - with Tom Hardy!!11 Wouldn't that be awesome?"
2018-09-17 23:46:36 Looks so cheesy don't know why
2018-09-18 07:56:26 Did they have to make his eyes our of cum?
2018-09-18 08:38:24 After I heard it's going to be PG-13 instead of R as it was supposed to be, I've lost all interest to see this. 
2018-09-18 08:03:00 The first trailer when he's mid-air and some tendrils erupt from him to grab a motorcycle to land on, the effects for that looked downright awful.
2018-09-18 10:01:31 I hate you sony
2018-09-18 05:16:36 God this already looks like a shit show 
2018-09-18 10:20:00 Something that doesn't make sense is the reason Venom's eyes are like that is because it's taken a form of it's own after merging with Spider-Man. So if it never attached to him then why would it form the eyes like that?
2018-09-18 10:55:04 They Sony'd this up real good :(
2018-09-18 12:02:10 Am I the only one bothered by the glossy, veiny look this Venom has? Like a cheap dildo.
2018-09-18 12:47:33 Why do I have the bad feeling that the Venom in the poster is the most we're gonna see Venom in the movie.
2018-09-18 15:41:16 Sony's plan for a Spider-Man minus Spider-Man universe is just pathetic.
2018-09-17 23:21:22 I know I'm meant to hate this film on reddit, but I love this poster and am super excited to see the film. I thought the whole turd in the wind line was hilarious. It probably helps I have literally no idea about anything to do with venom. 
2018-09-18 04:23:52 Remember when people heard Tom Hardy taking the role of Eddie and everyone was like "Yeah I see it." 

Now everyone is wallowing in pain 
2018-09-18 02:48:15 I'm working really hard to keep an open mind about this movie. All I really want is to be able to enjoy myself for 90 minutes. That's it. If I keep myself floating around this level of expectation then I'm bound to have a good time.
2018-09-18 03:41:30 I want to love it... but I know after I watch it I'll be like "yeesh".  Hoping and praying though.

&#x200B;
2018-09-18 07:24:12 It feels weird to say that I WANT a movie to suck, but Sony's "Spider-Man cinematic universe without Spider-Man" idea is so idiotic that I hope it dies as soon as possible.
2018-09-18 09:03:00 All those teeth may as well be dull given its going to be PG 13....

What could've been
2018-09-18 09:59:52 What the fuck is going on Sony? Are you this fucking retarded?
2018-09-18 10:40:51 I feel bad for Tom Hardy
2018-09-18 12:29:11 Something about this poster feels extremely underwhelming, it really looks fanmade.
2018-09-18 12:29:49 i bet tom hardy is kicking himself for agreeing to do this absolute pile of shit. 
2018-09-18 12:33:38 God this looks horrible 
2018-09-18 12:37:18 PG fucking 13.
2018-09-18 13:51:24 Rated **PG13.**  This movie was shot to be rated R and is being edited to be PG13. Its absolutely going to fail. All the execs care about is first week ticket sales.
2018-09-18 15:37:42 the closer this gets to release and the more shit they reveal about it, the more of a piece of shit it looks like
2018-09-18 16:17:53 I kinda think this movie is gonna bomb
2018-09-18 06:00:05 Looks like a Netflix special
2018-09-18 03:30:43 I’ve never been less excited about a movie. Ever.
2018-09-18 05:44:26 I love Venom but for me Tom Hardy is a casting fail. Also, I don’t want a typical bland Marcel movie for Venom but a dark thriller depicting the growing insanity of the host.
2018-09-18 07:55:01 This looks like what would happen if DC got a hold of a Marvel franchise.
2018-09-18 08:05:36 Are you people seriously still excited for this movie? It's gonna be trash.
2018-09-17 23:32:34 pg13 gtfo
2018-09-18 06:10:51 I’m praying that this film takes us all by surprise and turns out brilliantly, but that’s becoming less and less likely the closer it gets to release. I’m just baffled that studios are still pushing out generic, bland superhero movies in a post-Infinity War, post-Logan era. Do better! Fans deserve it. 
2018-09-18 07:16:14 I hope this fails and Sony gives Kevin Feige complete control over the spiderman properties.
2018-09-18 00:21:37 Looks pretty bad, really generic and muted. 
2018-09-18 03:58:14 There’s a venom movie coming out? Wow I never knew
2018-09-18 04:24:01 Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed?
2018-09-18 04:53:47 So a few days ago someone posted like a fan poster under the guise of an official poster and it got completely shit on. That thing looked way better than this piece of garbage.
2018-09-18 05:45:31 Another Sony Marvel movie that will undoubtedly be a disappointment. They didn’t even have the sense to make it R. Sony needs to give up all their Marvel properties to Marvel Studios.
2018-09-18 06:00:45 This looks so bad it makes that cheap avengers poster with the missing arc reactor look like a drew struzan poster
2018-09-18 07:26:53 This movie looks like shit 
2018-09-18 07:56:22 It upsets me so much that this movie is going to suck. That’s an amazing Venom.
2018-09-18 08:02:31 I'm sad. I just want a decent Venom in cinema. My only hope that the movie is goofy fun like Nicholas Cage in Ghost Rider.
2018-09-18 08:06:04 Thanks, I hate it
2018-09-18 08:08:57 I want to spend money to take away a ticket sale from this movie so I can help it fail so someone else can do it better.


Ever since Spider-Man 1 in 2004 I've been excited for a good Venom/Spider-Man movie. I don't want this movie to ruin that.


I guess I can still have an Insomniac Spider-Man game with a Venom storyline someday, if it's not already in-game and I haven't found it yet.
2018-09-18 08:09:10 Wow this is bad. Really bad. Any remaining excitement (it wasn’t much) I had for this movie is now gone.
2018-09-18 08:10:52 This is really meh. Why can't we be original with movie posters? Why can't it be a single, beautiful scene? Why does it always have to be a hodge podge? Just... Meh. 
2018-09-18 08:11:00 I'm Eddie Bwock
2018-09-18 08:28:11 god HOW much did they pay Michelle Williams to be in this
2018-09-18 09:19:27 Knock Knock let the flop in 
2018-09-18 09:22:25 Cooperate Shill: "I'm very excited for this next Sony product *cough* *cough* I mean umm movie.. yea movie. That's what those fatso, mouth-breathing comic book nerds call them right?"
2018-09-18 09:23:44 The fact that they made it pg despite fans almost unanimously wanting it to be rated R just goes to show how much Sony cares about the consumers over money.
2018-09-18 09:33:58 I was so excited for this movie ever since its been announced...Im not even going to see it now.
The pg 13 announcement just killed it for me
2018-09-18 10:06:11 Is it weird the font is upsetting me? 
2018-09-18 10:06:34 Riz and Tom giving us the Blue Steel, while Michelle Williams gazes wistfully at the sun setting on her career.
2018-09-18 10:18:08 Looks like shit
2018-09-18 10:21:45 Tom Hardy plays a disinterested man. Shocker.
2018-09-18 10:36:16 Wow, what a terrible poster.
2018-09-18 10:41:46 Really weak design. They should have obscured the figure in the back or perhaps actually done something creative and made it look like a comic book. This just looks like a Transformer's oily turd.
2018-09-18 10:52:15 Sony: “So are we ready to try to force a soulless Spider-Man Universe down the peoples’ throats again?”

The People: “No, we love the MCU.”

Sony: “...oh so that means you don’t want Spider-Man...so...Venom?”

The People: “What? Is it part of the MCU?”

Sony: “No.”

The People: “What? Why?”

Sony: “Money.”
2018-09-18 10:53:34 That..is one terrible poster :-0
2018-09-18 11:01:18 Did they pick the loser in a community competition on who could make the best fan made poster..?
2018-09-18 11:11:46 Venom dies at the end from the Infinity Gauntlet.
2018-09-18 11:43:54 This and Halle Berry's Catwoman will come as a DVD set
2018-09-18 11:54:33 Y'all are so negative

Can't wait to see the fanmade music videos with Skillet - Monster for this film

Edit: [It's already here!](https://youtu.be/A1nl-O8Am-M)
2018-09-18 12:53:37 What a terrible movie this is going to be
2018-09-18 12:59:14 This film just screams terrible
2018-09-18 13:01:08 Let's just hope this doesn't end like the Amazing Spiderman.
2018-09-18 13:32:17 This movie is like The Silence from Doctor Who, every time I stop looking at it I immediately forget that it exists.
2018-09-18 15:33:44 Holy shit this poster is awful. This is really damn hard to look at.
2018-09-18 15:34:30 I thought reddit was all pumped for this movie until I read the comments on this post. 

Fucking cynical people here. I'm just going to watch the movie, because it a venom movie. Glass half full fuckers
2018-09-18 15:49:19 So much hate in this thread.
2018-09-18 18:27:58 I've been openly apathetic about this movie, but Spidey PS4 has me ready to go to the theater and be disappointed!
2018-09-18 20:24:51 Turn on the standby mode
2018-09-19 07:06:30 This poster tells me all I need to know about the Venom movie, skip it.
2018-09-19 21:35:19 So I haven't been keeping up with Venom. It's just one off movie that doesn't belong in MCU like Spiderman Homecoming was, right?
2018-09-21 21:28:31 Why does this movie look like it's getting worse with each new reveal? It looks so bad it's hilarious. Definitely waiting for it online now

&#x200B;

Wonder what the reviews are gonna be for this "turd in the wind", lol. Can't wait to see how many people defend this bad movie
2018-09-18 04:16:52 Dogshit
2018-09-18 04:35:35 That font makes me picture the South Park guy doing his rob Schneider movie intro voice. Term Herdy is: Venom. Rated PG 13.
2018-09-18 05:17:38 IDK why but I get Catwoman vibes from this movie. Bad ones. 
2018-09-18 04:58:39 I don't even think Tom Hardy can save this movie for me. Good lord this looks bad.
2018-09-18 08:25:11 I think the poster is pretty badass... 
2018-09-18 00:48:51 I'm always amazed at how many copy/paste elements are in posters.  You'd think enough elements would be supplied to the designers.  (and if they need more, then they could receive it from the FX studio.)
2018-09-18 02:22:28 Not every poster needs so much going on.  Keep it simple and easy. Should have made it like a comic book cover
2018-09-18 04:22:00 As if to say this is what venom looks like in case you didn't know. This movie looks so bad to me. 
2018-09-18 05:36:08 This movie is going to be awful. 100% Rotten tomatoes is going to give it a 38%.
2018-09-18 05:39:28 Feels like Fant4stic
2018-09-18 05:42:56 Is that Topher grace on the left? 
2018-09-18 05:43:53 Everything about it looks awful.
2018-09-18 05:44:39 Alright boys it's 2001 again! 
2018-09-18 05:53:49 Why do I feel like this movie is way overhyped 
2018-09-18 07:23:29 Oof even the poster looks shitty 
2018-09-18 05:23:57 This movie is going to be the Nickelback of movies this year.
2018-09-17 22:57:22 I have to admit I'm curious to know how they're going to turn a villain into an antihero. By butchering the entire character and the lore behind it I'm sure.
2018-09-18 02:06:00 Does this movie mean Marvel can’t make a Venom character for the MCU?
2018-09-18 04:54:27 This is going to bomb so hard. 
2018-09-18 05:29:48 Is anyone else disappointed in Tom Hardy for this one?
2018-09-18 01:50:09 Rated PG-13! Hurray! 

Fuckheads.
2018-09-17 23:50:23 I like Venom, but man Marvel has earned my trust this past decade. Would rather have seen how they would have tackled him vs Tom Holland
2018-09-18 06:00:48 I have a feeling this movie will bomb.
2018-09-18 04:26:05 Ah, a sea of negative comments for no real reason. 

You stay classy Reddit. 

You dweebs have been crying out for a Venom movie for about 20 years. You get one, with one of the most popular actors going in the lead role no less, and all you do is fucking whinge about it. 

There’s nothing wrong with the poster either...
2018-09-17 23:51:38 Oof
2018-09-18 00:56:25 Very PG-13 poster. 
2018-09-18 02:48:10 Not really on this sub much. Why do people think this is going to be a flop?
2018-09-18 02:59:12 Hope it doesn’t suck
2018-09-18 03:08:38 Not a fan of that glazed-over Venom look.
2018-09-18 05:18:02 i’m getting immense X-Men Origins: Wolverine vibes from this movie
2018-09-18 05:19:32 I like the Alien poster, the word 'Alien', the egg cracking and the caption 'In space no one can hear you scream'.

I don't like this.
2018-09-18 05:44:51 Nobody asked for this.
2018-09-18 05:48:08 Oooh. Flash Gordon and The Golden Gate!
2018-09-18 07:12:07 I just can't see how this is going to be PG. 
2018-09-18 07:26:38 [deleted]
2018-09-18 08:34:20 I know everyone hates this poster, but compared to Spider-Man Homecoming and Black Panther's posters, this is a masterpiece.
2018-09-18 08:34:53 Can someone elaborate for me why y'all are hating on this movie? I'm excited for its release (so I can pirate it, no movie theaters here) so when I saw this thread I became a little confused.
2018-09-18 05:31:37 This reminds me of the Daredevil movie
2018-09-18 05:33:20 This is almost as bad as the Aquaman poster 
2018-09-18 05:42:46 Everyone is trashing this movie already. I haven't seen a trailer, but watch this movie be amazing and everyone try to back peddle their shit! 
2018-09-18 07:16:00 I'm surprised the Marvel logo isn't front and center, to trick the rubes into thinking this was made by the same folks who make decent comic book films.
2018-09-18 05:13:50 The moment the PG-13 rating was made public I lost all interest in the movie. Doing Venom PG-13 is almost as stupid as doing Deadpool PG-13. I was holding out hope they were going hard R, but nope. Sony execs have had two horrible Spider Mans to learn what audiences want from a super hero movie but they clearly haven't been paying attention. 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, 7PM slot on USA 4 months after release. Such a disappointment. 
2018-09-18 02:31:59 Tom Hardy wtf are you doing? 
2018-09-18 05:26:05 You either die a villain or you live long enough to see yourself become another villain.
2018-09-18 05:49:57 Lmaoo
2018-09-18 04:26:12 I have a feeling this movie could be gay.
2018-09-18 01:57:51 Still better than Homecoming poster
2018-09-18 05:14:15 The more I see, the worse this movie gets
2018-09-17 22:57:32 Please stop posting this. 
2018-09-17 23:18:16 Whether or not the movie is good, I have to say: this is a really awesome poster. 
2018-09-17 23:43:51 [deleted]
2018-09-18 04:53:24 Sweet. I haven’t seen the Golden Gate in a movie in a while. 
2018-09-18 04:55:27 Knock knock let the devil in
2018-09-18 05:08:52 While I don't like comic book movies to do poorly because it hurts the overall reputation, I kind of want this one to tank just out of spite to Sony. Maybe it will force them to relinquish all the Spidey rights back to Marvel Studios.
2018-09-18 05:12:44 So does this take place in Sam Fransisco AND Florida where spaceships take off or are spaceships taking off in SF now? But more importantly why are those two locations so prominently featured here 
2018-09-18 05:16:35 This poster is just so.......... Sony
2018-09-18 05:18:47 The only reason I was remotely interested in this film is because of Riz Ahmed, but even that feels it won't be enough to see it in theaters. No rubber dinghy rapids, bro. 
2018-09-18 05:19:56 Looks like a cluster fuck of design put together by a marketing committee of non-comicbook readers. Also, so many phalluses.
2018-09-18 05:21:32 Would much prefer the original horror vibe from the original teaser. 
2018-09-18 05:23:22 Well I liked the poster.
2018-09-18 05:29:46 Carnage bottom left?
2018-09-18 05:30:25 What a twist it would be if this turns out to be pretty good 
2018-09-18 05:31:02 Is that Anti Venom in the bottom left? I wouldn't be surprised if they blew him on the first movie
2018-09-18 05:32:52 Venom looks like a big guy.
2018-09-18 05:34:06 I’m not sure how I feel about this 
2018-09-18 05:34:51 *sound of a giant turd getting pucker-pinched off, falling, and hitting the water with enough force to splash the buttcheeks and testes*
2018-09-18 05:35:56 Tom hardy, the character actor that never knows how to pick characters, but if he does enough of them, some of them should be good. 
2018-09-18 05:35:59 Is it rated R?
2018-09-18 05:39:57 sim-bi-oats
2018-09-18 05:40:48 Dollars to donuts — the climax of the movie is going to take place around that shuttle on the left hand side as it prepares to take off. 
2018-09-18 05:50:35 The mercenary. The symbiotic man.
2018-09-18 05:54:31 Fucking Metal 🤟🏻
2018-09-18 06:06:52 When you market the fuck out of something, its a sign it will fail
2018-09-18 06:07:12 I feel the stronger urge to boo at every media release that is tied to 'Venom'; it keeps getting lamer.
2018-09-18 06:12:47 If you zoom in, you can see the turd in the wind. Nice Easter Egg
2018-09-18 06:12:56 I know it will be bad, but I really want to see it. 
2018-09-18 06:15:04 Also, hard to believe that guy on the left was a defecting Imperial Pilot not long ago
2018-09-18 06:17:42 PG-13 rating killed my interest.
2018-09-18 06:17:46 i retract my previous statement about the movie's poster division knowing what they are doing.

edit: also it seems they are going to butcher eddie brock's character. unless it's not eddie brock. then the movie might as well go straight to bluray.
2018-09-18 06:26:09 Someone needs to fire their Graphic Designer. 
2018-09-18 06:26:14 I hope people don’t go into this expecting some type of Shakespearean movie like how they did with The Predator. 
2018-09-18 06:45:26 Reminds me of the Tom Criuse Mummy poster 
2018-09-18 06:50:35 Rated pg-13 
2018-09-18 06:51:09 Ugh, first the trailer and now this. Don't have much faith in this movie anymore.
2018-09-18 07:07:55 God this movie looks garbage.
2018-09-18 07:08:15 Wow this is bad
2018-09-18 07:08:31 Knock knock, let the devil in 
2018-09-18 07:08:48 I hate Sony so much for insisting on forcing this shit on us and ruining Marvel's chance of doing Venom properly in the MCU
2018-09-18 07:08:55 im i crazy or did they literally use that 0815 free brush for the big "V"?
2018-09-18 07:09:28 I’m sick of all these comic book movies. Fuck this, after playing spiderman on ps4, I want more comic book games. 
2018-09-18 07:10:13 Tom Hardy staring in "Soulless Corporate Film"
2018-09-18 07:10:23 While I really don't want it to, I'm having a hard time seeing how this movie won't suck :(
2018-09-18 07:11:50 Now is that thin sim-by-oat in the lower left-hand corner suppose to be Carnage, or just generic Venom knock-off number 235 and I'm just reaching?
2018-09-18 07:11:53 this is like something I'd see in a pirated movie in a flea market LOL
2018-09-18 07:12:54 Lol this movie's gonna be so bad
2018-09-18 07:13:20 Everything about this movie is just ... off. The origin story is gonna grate on me since it has zero to do with the actual origin. The dialogue we’ve heard is tell don’t show instead of show don’t tell and on top of that it’s from Sony which has a track record of superhero stinkers. If this movie does well I will be truly flabbergasted. 
2018-09-18 07:13:40 It's funny. As movie trailers have gotten better and better over the years posters have gone through a similar trajectory in the opposite direction.
2018-09-18 07:16:03 not feeling the venom costume . eyes dont seem right.
2018-09-18 07:16:26 This looks like a pile of garbage. 
2018-09-18 07:18:21 This is will not be a good movie 
2018-09-18 07:18:51 Sony releasing a pg-13 comic book movie? I think I'll pass.
2018-09-18 07:18:52 Pg 13 feels like it will be disappointing washed out family freindly version of venom.
2018-09-18 07:18:52 I will never care. 
2018-09-18 07:19:39 This movie will suck.
2018-09-18 07:21:10 That sinking feeling when you finally face the fact that this movie will be a dud.
2018-09-18 07:22:18 This is unironically awful
2018-09-18 07:24:00 I was gonna watch it til I read it's lg13
2018-09-18 07:24:14 This cover looks like hot garbage. Could you imagine a comic book with this cover? Fucking awful. 
2018-09-18 07:24:21 Please be good please be good. Dammit please. To me it seems like making a great and proper Venom movie should be common sense. Fingers crossed.
2018-09-18 07:25:13 Ehhh I still have an overarching sense of skepticism about this movie. I *want* it to be good, but I’m already going in with low expectations. Hoping it goes above and beyond those, but wouldn’t be all that surprised if it doesn’t. 

Edit: the PG-13 rating definitely adds to that skepticism even more. 
2018-09-18 07:25:54 Meh I actually like it. 
2018-09-18 07:27:18 Rated PG-13. Cause someone on the movie wanted their teenage son to watch it. 
2018-09-18 07:27:23 Venom looks like hot garbage without some sort of symbol on his chest. What do you think would look good there?
2018-09-18 07:27:33 If this doesn't bomb HARD I'll be surprised.
2018-09-18 07:27:54 In dazzling Pg
2018-09-18 07:28:57 Fan made?
2018-09-18 07:29:41 I had high hopes for this movie but after reading some of these comments, I feel like I shouldn't.
2018-09-18 07:30:01 Oooooh, baby no. They make  it look like he's going to be some Godzilla sized monster.
2018-09-18 07:30:22 I really like Tom Hardy, Venom is my favorite Spiderman villain, but this movie has hot garbage written all over it.
2018-09-18 07:31:12 Does anyone really give a fuck about this movie?
2018-09-18 07:31:35 I hope it **looks** good at least
2018-09-18 07:32:08 Honestly I don’t care how shitty it is, I just want a lot of Venom scenes and I’m not talking about his black sludge slinging out of Eddie. I want the whole suit swinging around and going wild.
2018-09-18 07:32:15 This movie looks like garbage and I've been saying it from the beginning.When they first trailer came out I'm not sure how anyone thought this was a good idea
2018-09-18 07:32:15 Legitimate question here. I heard when the movie life was coming out with Ryan Reynolds and  Jake Gyllenhaal that there was a small chance the end of the movie would lead to venom. I just noticed the crashed LIFE escape pod. Any connections!?!
2018-09-18 07:32:52 Sony?  No Tom Holland or MCU crossover?  Features Tom Hardy? I smell box office bomb.
2018-09-18 07:33:30 Good Lord, even by super hero movie standards this looks bad...
2018-09-18 07:33:59 This is going to be awful
2018-09-18 07:34:45 Trash
2018-09-18 07:35:10 You👏can’t👏make👏a👏Venom👏movie👏without👏Spider-man.
2018-09-18 07:35:29 Where is Spoderman?
2018-09-18 07:35:33 Literally everything is this poster is ham-fisted in, it's so cramped.

Riot looks like a Jackson Pollock's wet dream where he fucks a fleshlight made out of grey paint. 
2018-09-18 07:36:08 Hi my name is Eddie Bwock, and I'm a reportah.
2018-09-18 07:36:48 This kinda feels like one of those old movies desiged to sell a crap load of action figures. Which leads me to my next question: are there a bunch of new lines of action figures/toys tied in with this movie?
2018-09-18 07:37:11 Tom Hardy looks surprised that he’s going to be in a Venom movie. 
2018-09-18 07:37:15 I will watch anything with Tom Hardy. Im not gay or anything but fuck that man is easy to look at 
2018-09-18 07:37:15 I am just not interested in this!!
2018-09-18 07:38:52 This years Fan4stic and Amazing Spider-Man 2
2018-09-18 07:39:31 It looks so dumb
2018-09-18 07:41:14 ok
2018-09-18 07:41:45 I would love to see Tom Holland fight Tom Hardy but idk how the stories and the character right's work with each other
2018-09-18 07:42:03 This looks....bad. like they tried to cram is way way too much stuff. I hope Venom can join the MCU so he can have a good movie.
2018-09-18 07:42:22 This movie will be just as good as Predator /s
2018-09-18 07:42:39 PG-13
2018-09-18 07:43:05 Everyone is shitting on this movie for being PG-13, but they also want Marvel to have a movie with Venom. What rating do you guys expect from Marvel Comic's flagship character? 
2018-09-18 07:43:28 I really love all three actors so, ratings shenanigans aside, I do want to see this. 
2018-09-18 07:43:54 Wonder why they didn't just try fit in some more scenes from the movie... I mean, at some point you might as well? Right?

Jesus, this movie just can't fucking help itself.
2018-09-18 07:44:16 When is this out?
2018-09-18 07:44:20 Rated PG*
2018-09-18 07:44:40 It's about time Sony loses ownership of the Spiderman universe. This is ridiculous. 
2018-09-18 07:45:40 I feel like I'm the only one excited for this movie
2018-09-18 07:47:17 Yup! This is Sony. Looks just like the homecoming poster they made.
2018-09-18 07:47:34 Tom Hardy really does have a fetish for masks, damn has he really wore one in ever single role?????
2018-09-18 07:47:34 Everything about this movie just seems tired and redundant.
2018-09-18 07:49:21 This looks like a movie 
2018-09-18 07:49:30 as usual, i am in the minority, and i think this movie looks really cool and venom is literally my favorite character in the marvel universe.
2018-09-18 07:49:51  All I want is to see a modern carnage. 

can we hurry up and get to him already? 


2018-09-18 07:51:14 I've never been hyped, then confused, and then completely uninterested all before a movie even releases.
2018-09-18 07:51:36 I was all for this movie until they said symbiyote.

Fuck that.  This movie is dead to me.
2018-09-18 07:51:47 guy on the left looks a little too much like chris kattan
2018-09-18 07:52:22 Venom looks like he's holding a camera and just said "ok now lets do a silly one"
2018-09-18 07:52:32 I’ll admit I’m not overly attached to Venom as a character but even so why is it every single time I see a trailer for this movie I just can’t bring myself to care? You’d think with Sony throwing all that money at a Spider-Man adjacent property I should care a little but I just can’t bring myself to.
2018-09-18 07:53:30 Rated PG-13 for shit.
2018-09-18 07:54:53 This is one of those stupid marvel movies where a scientist invents something and goes mad with power and turns into the antagonist, tries to kill the city, and the main guy fights him once in the final battle. 
2018-09-18 07:55:41 It looks so bad...

2018-09-18 07:57:37 This looks horrible
2018-09-18 07:58:56 Tom Hardy stars in...The Hangries. You won't like him when he's hungry.
2018-09-18 07:59:13 honestly just cringey now
2018-09-18 08:00:15 Looks awful, even compared to Spawn movie. Even spawn got a legit soundtrack.
2018-09-18 08:01:28 Another CGI fuckfest in IMAX that nobody asked for. Who cares about character building anymore, anyway? 
2018-09-18 08:03:09 Fully anticipating this movie to be complete dogshit. Hope it inspires the MCU to do Venom correctly.
2018-09-18 08:03:18 I wanted this movie to be good, but deep down I knew it wouldn't be
2018-09-18 08:03:26 Please tell me this movie is rated R
2018-09-18 08:03:28 i'm so pumped for this movie. Venom is my absolute favorite villain/vigilante character from MU.  I really hope the movie isn't bad.  
2018-09-18 08:04:15 Is that Carnage on the bottom left of the poster??!!
2018-09-18 08:06:16 Says something positive about Venom. Gets downvoted to hell. *Sigh*
2018-09-18 08:06:32 Tom Hardy is reason enough to go see it.
2018-09-18 08:06:37 I didn't like the trailer. I dont like of ALL movies, a VENOM movie is pg-13... I'm still gonna see it but i dont like what im seeing!
2018-09-18 08:13:39 Look at that! Nasty mouth! 
all that gross detail wow somebody had fun doing that
2018-09-18 08:13:54 Please don't suck please don't suck please....  
2018-09-18 08:15:01 I'm honestly shocked at how much I don't want to watch this movie. Venom was one of my favorite characters growing up. Who wouldn't want to have the symbiote giving you strength and crazy powers. Also never having to change. I specifically remember Peter Parker just morphing new clothes. For some reason, that was one of the things that stuck with my the most. 
2018-09-18 08:16:01 We are Venom. 
2018-09-18 08:18:03 Jesus fucking christ they aren't trying anymore
2018-09-18 08:18:27 S hiM bY hOot
2018-09-18 08:18:42 Rates T for teen 
2018-09-18 08:19:49 Is Jenny Slate still in this movie?
2018-09-18 08:23:39 I'm the biggest venom fan around was beyond excited to hear was finally getting a movie was even stoked for tom hardy announcement but the pg13 rating is a punch in the gut I just can't seem to shake.
2018-09-18 08:25:16 The symbiote looks like it's a foot away from his body.  Why is the photoshop so bad?
2018-09-18 08:25:41 Rated PG-13
2018-09-18 08:26:24 Serious question, it seems to me like every movie poster/magazine cover for movies I've seen in the past couple of years have looked like complete shit, even when the end product in the movie doesn't look all that bad. Is there a reason for this?
2018-09-18 08:26:46 Wow sure is a lot going on here. Like a visual synopsis of the plot almost
2018-09-18 08:27:13 Why, Tom Hardy, why? 
2018-09-18 08:27:36 Member when Reddit was so hyped for this movie? I membah...
2018-09-18 08:29:28 Fuck it, other than the fact that he doesn't have the Spider logo, I think it's pretty good. 
2018-09-18 08:29:30 Heavy breathing*
2018-09-18 08:30:13 essentially tentacle hentai
2018-09-18 08:30:30 This movie is gonna suck. Mark my words.
2018-09-18 08:30:34 You're trash brock
2018-09-18 08:31:43 Sontar-HA!
2018-09-18 08:32:03 Lol at Tom hardy being made to look bigger than both Riz and Michelle.
2018-09-18 08:32:09 I want to see this poster on the front page of Reddit as much as I want to see this movie. 
2018-09-18 08:33:13 Y’all remember when movie posters were an art form? 
2018-09-18 08:33:55 I was so pumped for this movie based off Hardy being the lead, and the teaser. 

And theennnnn I heard Venom’s voice. Legit sounds like a villain from a GameCube Resident Evil game. On the cringe meter, I’d give it a solid 43.
2018-09-18 08:35:01 The shuttle says LIFE!
2018-09-18 08:35:07 Wow I'm surprised that they casted two actors with the same name! I see Tom Hardy in white font and one male and one female actors next to him both named [blank].
2018-09-18 08:38:54 This looks like a one off movie imo
2018-09-18 08:39:00 The best thing I can say about this poster is that you can’t hear Tom Hardy’s accent in it.
2018-09-18 08:39:34 Wow that's a crappy poster.

This is reminding me more and more of some shitty Gerard Butler movie from the late 2000's early teens that goes direct to cable/video. 
2018-09-18 08:40:04 Just watch A Star Is Born instead!!!
2018-09-18 08:40:39 This one's gonna tank so goddamn hard 
2018-09-18 08:41:45 Starring "Tom Hardy" and two other poor nameless fuckers that stooped this low in their acting career.

I just find it weird that it's only hardy's name on the poster.
2018-09-18 08:43:04 I just wish they took their time with this and set it up correctly.   Since Marvel and Sony are getting along and open to working together.    It would only make sense to have Venom appear in a more recent Spider-Man film.   Establish him as a character and villain.   

I get they want him to be a anti-hero type here and that's fine Venom can be that and can be that perfectly.   The next Spider-Man film after featuring Venom could introduce  Carnage which you see Venom take a path to a more anti-hero grounds.     Work with Marvel and have characters like Cloak & Dagger,  Avengers, Starfire, and others appear in the film.   

Then finally make a stand alone Venom movie.   Where he can be a badass anti-hero.   This way  viewers are already invested into him and want to see where he goes because they want to continue the journey with him.  

Oh well, I hope the movie turns out to be good despite my different view on how this should have been approached. 
2018-09-18 08:43:32 I’m saving my criticism of this movie until I actually see it.
2018-09-18 08:44:01 Still pg13 tho
2018-09-18 08:44:30 I was so excited when i first heard Tom Hardy plays Venom...

Then the whole pg12 thing came out...

Then the first trailer...

Then the second trailer...

Then this blant poster...

So not excited anymore :(
2018-09-18 08:45:17 I'm so worried that this is going to be bad
2018-09-18 08:45:18 A buddy of mine saw it (he works in advertising cutting trailers) he told me it was awful. Recommended a hard pass.
2018-09-18 08:46:25 So I kind of like it.

Not like, the poster, but seeing Venom in all his glory, all the bits of symbiote just swirling around

I knew to expect it, but seeing the lack of the white spider logo on the chest does seem very off. I get maybe putting a V there would have been 100x worse, but it feels... bare.
2018-09-18 08:46:28 I don’t know if it’s just me but Jesus everything about this movie looks like trash 
2018-09-18 08:46:46 Tom Hardy clearly owed someone a favor. 
2018-09-18 08:46:49 Okay. *Now* it sucks. I'd had hopes. I gave full benefit of the doubt. Even after seeing the trailer, I knew in my heart of hearts that this was the best Venom on film we were going to get. I was able to brush all the drastic changes aside, even as a lifelong Spider-Man fan.

Seeing this though. This...  this overwhelmingly generic  action-movie poster, this painfully bland unwilling-hero-accepts-his-demonz, this *tenth-grade graphic design project,* and I'm out, I'm fucking done, all the nails are in the coffin. This is what did it for me.
2018-09-18 08:46:58 Tried to cram too much into one poster. Just looks so dense
2018-09-18 08:47:11 PG13
2018-09-18 08:48:29 I'm just glad Venom is not a little bitch in this one.
2018-09-18 08:49:10 One of my favorite actors, doing one of my favorite comic book characters, and somehow I couldn't be less excited for this movie...
2018-09-18 08:49:23 This is gunna fucking suck.
2018-09-18 08:49:56 I like everything except the tentacles on Tom Hardy. They look like they were added really quickly in Photoshop.
2018-09-18 08:51:42 Every new bit of information I get about this movie just digs its grave deeper and deeper. 
2018-09-18 08:52:57 Sony has ruined this villain with their awful trailers and now this embarrassing poster. This is worse than the spider-man poster they released. Really sad. 
2018-09-18 08:53:33 100% Tom Hardy can do a better Venom than Eric from 70s show. I just truly hope this movie wont suck.
2018-09-18 08:54:40 Staring ONLY Tom Hardy.........as every character in the movie
2018-09-18 08:55:16 Tom Hardy's expression says it all.
2018-09-18 08:56:17 Im just not excited for Venom by Sony pictures. Maybe its because I have a feeling the script isnt good or its PG-13
2018-09-18 08:56:31 I didn’t see a proper venom movie until I was already a man. By then it was nothing to me but BLINDING
2018-09-18 08:56:59 I can’t wait to miss this one in theaters. 
2018-09-18 08:57:34 So this takes place in the same place during the same time as ant man right?
2018-09-18 08:57:49 Am I the only one who is excited for this movie?
2018-09-18 08:58:38 Notice the huge "V" overlay on the image? Lol fuck this really. I swear he's gonna have a V on his chest or something. 
2018-09-18 08:58:54 Wow not many with high hopes for the movie it seems lol
2018-09-18 09:01:12 https://tenor.com/y9OK.gif
2018-09-18 09:01:49 This one doesn't say anti-hero on it so I'm not sure what the film is about.
2018-09-18 09:02:43 Meh, it looks like it's trying real hard to be edgy. Like adding rims to a Pontiac Aztek.
2018-09-18 09:04:14 Meh
2018-09-18 09:04:56 Why are people hating on the movie already?
2018-09-18 09:05:40 I like the subtleness of it
2018-09-18 09:06:00 The poster makes it look like such a low budget film
2018-09-18 09:07:57 [PROTOTYPE] the movie
2018-09-18 09:08:05 The Eminem song will be better than the movie 
2018-09-18 09:09:16 This is going to be the worst Tom Hardy movie in recent years. 
2018-09-18 09:12:41 After watching the two previews with every one of my friends and watching their faces... This will be the coolest movie to date.
2018-09-18 09:12:42 I want him to shove that tounge so far up my butt
2018-09-18 09:12:52 I’m 95% sure Riot is going to have three scenes and be the most forgettable marvel villain since Malekith.
2018-09-18 09:12:55 I can't be the only one who is really worried this won't be Venom... it will be Tom Hardy Launches Black Tendrils From His Body...

I'm just going to be super disappointed if it's like the preview with people getting knocked around by tentacles and then like .5 seconds of actual Venom.
2018-09-18 09:17:09 lol thought that was topher grace on the left
2018-09-18 09:18:56 Ew Venom's eyes are squeezed together at the front of the face. What shit designer made that abomination? Seriously he looks derp retarded.
2018-09-18 09:19:27 PG13 Venom movie? fuckin love you Tom but no thanks..
2018-09-18 09:19:37 I wonder who's making it

>Sony

YUP!

How does Sony still have a movie business?
2018-09-18 09:21:18 I would put that poster on a straight-to-dvd movie.
2018-09-18 09:21:53 The shot of the symbiote battle in the bottom left looks so out of place. Like they were desperate for finished VFX shots to throw onto a poster so they just copy/pasted the shot from the trailer.
2018-09-18 09:22:25 PG-13 SMH
2018-09-18 09:22:52 I am going to violently not see this movie
2018-09-18 09:22:58 This movie looks sick
2018-09-18 09:24:30 It's as if the poster is forewarning us of the awfully snap edited, reshoot garbage that we'll likely get. 
2018-09-18 09:25:19 Everyone is shitting on this movie which I find bizarre. I thought most of the community here was looking forward to this film?

Edit: nvm, I think everyone is pissy about the PG-13 rating 
2018-09-18 09:25:42 I trust Hardy. Will wait for the reviews to roll out rather than jump on the hate train.
2018-09-18 09:25:49 What is this PoS poster? Shitty PS job, why are scenes from movie there, why are the "human" characters shown? Just pust the face of Venom and title Venom. No need for rest of that corny BS. 
2018-09-18 09:26:42 Like I know this movie is going to be so meh and I know I’m still going to see it Bc I’m comic book movie trash and Tom Hardy trash...
But I can’t for the life of me figure out why I love this poster so much.
2018-09-18 09:26:50 There’s so much Sony can do with the expanded Spider-Man universe even without Spider-Man. I hope they don’t waste that and allow this to be a one-off. Hell, I bet they could get away with a Scarlet-Spider movie to get around their contract with Disney borrowing Spideys likeness. 
2018-09-18 09:27:40 They even snuck some cyan-orange in.
2018-09-18 09:27:42 The fact that they’re showing riot so much either means they’re misdirecting by saying that’s the main battle when there could be carnage or something else amazing or they’re blowing their load all at once
2018-09-18 09:28:50 I'm so distracted by how... moist... the symbiote looks. It's like the thick, goopy symbiote from Spiderman 3 was found during a rainfall and they mistook the rain as part of it or something.

> Everyone! Fill these empty oil cans with as much rainfall as you can! We think the symbiote needs it to survive!

Then back in the lab, they have a pool that was just a glass of water's worth of symbiote goop, and the rest was filled with water. One of the janitors has to go into the pool room and stir it occasionally to make sure it's even.

Tom Hardy will be the symbiote's vessel to take on what almost drowned it: Venom -- the anti-water.
2018-09-18 09:30:22 This looks so lazy.
2018-09-18 09:30:44 I just do not see how this won’t suck. 
2018-09-18 09:32:03 I can't wait for the new jojo movie 
2018-09-18 09:32:18 Reminds me of Sharknado
2018-09-18 09:32:38 Is this gona end up being another Green Lantern?
2018-09-18 09:33:41 Look like an anime than a Marvel movie, lol
2018-09-18 09:34:31 Glad to see everyone thinks this will suck
2018-09-18 09:35:50 This movie looks really terrible
2018-09-18 09:36:11 Worst poster for such a good character
2018-09-18 09:36:15 This looks bad and boring. It's trying to tell you what the movie is about, in the poster, instead of just...making a neat poster.
2018-09-18 09:36:35 Everything seems so trashy and cliché about this, bad CG, corny af posters, shitty dialogue. Not sure. What I do like is a comic book movie set in San Francisco instead of New York.
2018-09-18 09:38:42 Is it just me or does venom look way to cartoonish
2018-09-18 09:42:01 Such beautiful potential gone to waste. This looks like a TV series...

Hardy has some serious lifting to do
2018-09-18 09:42:46 Fuck the hive mind,  this poster looks awesome!
2018-09-18 09:43:01 I want to see this movie because I really, really like Tom Hardy but man it just looks so bad. 
2018-09-18 09:43:18 r/movieposterporn
2018-09-18 09:43:40 All the hate but I'm still going to see it. Tom Hardy can do no wrong.
2018-09-18 09:47:34 I can't begin to express my disappointment that this film will be rated PG-13. Seriously what's the point?
2018-09-18 09:49:05 I hate the desaturated color correction. Same one that various Marvel movies use, like Captain America 2 and Thor Dark World come to mind.
2018-09-18 09:49:29 I don't care what anyone says, I'm gonna see it just to hear that symbiote voice. I love it.
2018-09-18 09:49:49 Jesus fuck.
2018-09-18 09:54:08 Wow
2018-09-18 09:55:56 I was hoping that the Venom film would have went something like the short film (https://youtu.be/7YDYL6oECjU) The Truth in Journalism. I want a character study film. Kinda like where the possible *Joker* film is going. This just looks like something out of the early Ghost Rider era.

Just some guy's opinion on the internet.
Thanks for reading. 
2018-09-18 09:56:42 I think this looks pretty cool.
2018-09-18 09:57:59 WE. ARE. CASH GRAB.
2018-09-18 09:58:22 Goddammit this movie has 'studio over produced garbage' written all over it.  What a shame.
2018-09-18 09:58:44 OH MY CGI
2018-09-18 10:03:07 Wow, that looks good! 
2018-09-18 10:04:15 Yeah dude. I was blown away by Thanos. That’s the new standard. I’m with you on the back tendrils too. I want a dope Venom movie but I sadly don’t think that this will be it.  It all comes across very cheesy and as much as I love Tom Hardy, he always mumbles and has weird American accent choices. I also laughed out loud when the tendrils gran his motorcycle and Pull him back on his bike. Still better than Topher Grace Venom though I suppose! Let’s hope it proves me wrong.
2018-09-18 10:04:26 Sony Pictures? Sony Pictures. 
2018-09-18 10:04:27 That bridge has been through so many destructions of epic proportions. 
2018-09-18 10:06:05 In big letters, there needs to be the words RATED PG-13.
2018-09-18 10:07:11 That moment in the trailer where he grabs the bike in mid-air in slow-mo 🤮🤮
2018-09-18 10:07:19 I didn't like the trailers but the poster actually looks cool to me. Tom's face looks weird but overall it looks neat. 
2018-09-18 10:07:28 Could they not make Tom Hardys mouth not gape open like a doofus? He's an empowering looking man, just not with that mouth catching flies. 
2018-09-18 10:08:01 It's just too busy, and Hardy's face is badly lit
2018-09-18 10:08:34 Another movie where Tom Hardy has something stuck on his face.
2018-09-18 10:09:45 Unfortunate that this movie is gonna be bad. So much potential. 
2018-09-18 10:10:00 Makes me think Venom is a stand In a JoJo movie
2018-09-18 10:10:58 They are really trying sell it just with his name
2018-09-18 10:11:02 Honestly, everything about this movie seems terrible so far.. Which is why I think it just might work.  Expectations are so low, if the movie ends up being even moderately good, we'll be in good shape.
2018-09-18 10:11:12 Venom look more like a anti-hero than a villain.
2018-09-18 10:12:14 PG 13 trash 
2018-09-18 10:12:25 SYM BYE OTE
2018-09-18 10:12:40 Is it just me or have movie posters been getting really weak lately? As in very obviously composited and poorly blended?
2018-09-18 10:17:17 Somewhat reminds me of Prototype, they should make a new game
2018-09-18 10:18:31 Predicting it right now, this movie will be mediocre
2018-09-18 10:18:58 The CGI in this movie looks weak.  Which sucks, because it's a CGI movie. 
2018-09-18 10:19:37 san Francisco?? wtf?
2018-09-18 10:23:12 My Prediction,

* Dialogue - 2/10
* Story - 4/10
* Visuals - 9/10
2018-09-18 10:24:21 These superhero type movies have a weird love for drones
What's the deal with that?
2018-09-18 10:28:07 Don’t want this 
2018-09-18 10:28:57 Teal and orange. How original.
2018-09-18 10:30:32 I can't wait to hear Eminems track in this movie
2018-09-18 10:32:44 What movies from Sony are actually good other than Spider Man?
2018-09-18 10:32:56 Is that Carnage on the bottom left?
2018-09-18 10:35:25 Is Jenny Slate still in this or did she get cut after everyone got mad about her saying "Sym-bye-ote"?
2018-09-18 10:36:10 I want this to be a good movie just because I don't want to have 4 suicide squad movies and 3 Harley Quinn movies every other year
2018-09-18 10:40:15 Looks like one of those shitty Japanese live action anime movies
2018-09-18 10:40:27 "Knock knock, let the devil in!" 
2018-09-18 10:45:33 The font for VENOM looks very Disney esq...oh wait.
2018-09-18 10:49:18 Waits for venom AMA
2018-09-18 10:49:46 K
2018-09-18 10:54:33 Does he have wings? What are those two dark things above his shoulders?
2018-09-18 10:56:21 Looked great, until I zoomed in on Tom Hardy and realised how painfully awful the photoshopping is.
2018-09-18 10:56:34 Looks generic
2018-09-18 10:57:26 This movie will be poorly recieved..

Theres no interesting villian..


2018-09-18 11:00:21 Dead in the water. 
2018-09-18 11:00:45 On the one hand, it looks pretty bad.
2018-09-18 11:04:48 That poster looks dumb
2018-09-18 11:06:12 So any official news on the rating? Is it pg-13 or R
2018-09-18 11:07:12 How's everybody doin tonight?
2018-09-18 11:13:09 Too much CGI imo .
2018-09-18 11:14:06 Jesus they have a dji phantom drone on there wtf
2018-09-18 11:15:43 I mean, it's slightly better than that terrible half face tom half face venom one? *slightly*
2018-09-18 11:16:00 What the fuck is even in the bottom left. It looks like a shitty knockoff of Venom fighting a shitty venom.
2018-09-18 11:16:24 Avi Arad produced it, he was the reason we got the weak Venom in Spider-Man 3 so I’m keeping my expectations really low for this film. 
2018-09-18 11:19:08 I love Tom Hardy and the venom voice and aesthetic are pretty cool... Still pretty sure this movie will be garbage
2018-09-18 11:20:58 VENOM, fighting his arch enemy, POISON.
2018-09-18 11:21:08 Maybe this will be good jk
2018-09-18 11:25:01 Oh look, theres's Carnage on the poster. I think.
It's Doomsday all over again.
2018-09-18 11:25:40 *Looks over the poster.*

...yep, still don't give a fuck about it.
2018-09-18 11:26:32 Some Sony Executive: "Well, I really can't decide between the poster with the Black V, the one with just Venom, or the classic floating actors one....

I know! Let's just have the artist blend them all!!! Then I can't choose wrong! I knew I was brilliant at this job!

Oh and have them add a space ship and something from the city the movie is set in! It's important people know this isn't just about some slimey suited shmoh!"

The internet: 😖
2018-09-18 11:27:12 Such a shit poster. What am I looking at? Far too much going on, there’s too much information on there. 
2018-09-18 11:34:34 How incredibly generic... Tom Hardy looks so awkward in this poster
2018-09-18 11:36:50 It's gonna suu /\ uu \/ uuck
2018-09-18 11:36:51  FX has the movies 
2018-09-18 11:38:33 one of the most pointless comic book films ever made, right behind Catwoman. 
2018-09-18 11:41:55 I wish it was rated R

I would have loved a scary/violent Venom film
2018-09-18 11:42:24 This is going to tank so hard.

I really don't know what they're thinking.
2018-09-18 11:44:54 Why is there a pic of the bay bridge on the poster, aren't they supposed to be in New York
2018-09-18 11:44:57 Why are modern movie posters so bad! 
2018-09-18 11:46:32 Is this going to be the first bad choice hardy made on his career? 
2018-09-18 11:46:54 There's sometimes about this poster that tries to convinces me that the spideyverse FOX is trying to create it's good to be great without Spiderman in it. Another thing that bugs me is that they are to make venom having it's own mind and works like doctor strange cloak engineer though it looks cool. If I don't see you dance like Tobey then you have waited your money on popcorn and a ticket. Though  prejudiced.I want to see this on my mobile. 
2018-09-18 11:48:32 Ok I’m getting pretty tired of the symmetric marvel posters
2018-09-18 11:52:10 Venom: PG13

A turd in the wind indeed
2018-09-18 11:57:33 Goddamnit everytime something new regarding this movie comes out it makes it seem worse and worse
2018-09-18 12:00:29 Just to clarify. Is, or is this not part of the Alien Canon?
2018-09-18 12:05:40 It looks better than the Aquaman poster.
2018-09-18 12:06:09 WAKE ME UP INSIDE 

CANT WAKE UP 

HOPFULLY Sony will give it to Marvel  to make a decent moive 

2018-09-18 12:08:19 That’s a really really poor photoshop of the black goop on top of tom hardy. They seriously didnt take one production still with effects on? Were there never practical effects?

Ain’t good.
2018-09-18 12:09:59 PG-13
2018-09-18 12:10:42 They really should've made this rated R. 
2018-09-18 12:11:23 Literally can't wait for this movie!! So hyped
2018-09-18 12:16:56 "Slash SLASH slAsh BITE bite"
...*no blood*...
Venom PG-13
2018-09-18 12:18:05 I thought other guy was shroud
2018-09-18 12:19:05 If this hadn’t been rated PG 13, I might have considered its chances of being good, a little higher...
2018-09-18 12:24:27 Rated peeegeee 13
2018-09-18 12:28:54 Venommmmmmm. Mmmmmmm mmmmmmm

2018-09-18 12:32:59 It must suck whenever Venom accidentally bites his tongue
2018-09-18 12:38:41 I don't think this looks awful at all, but knowing it's PG-13 makes it suck really hard. If it was actually hard violent and edgy it could be really fun lol. But of course it's not, because of course you'll make one of the more brutal antihero characters in Marvel PG-13. And people here are hoping for a Carnage movie. Pro-tip: you don't get to call anything Carnage if it isn't rated R.
2018-09-18 12:45:46 Does anyone else notice Carnage in the poster?  Lower left of Tom Hardy.
2018-09-18 12:48:24 I think venom game will be so awesome  bit similar to prototype but with more parasitic combat moves. 
2018-09-18 12:49:53 Did they hire the top people from
2004-2007 to make this movie? 
2018-09-18 12:54:26 So I read a comic last night (Spider-Man vs deadpool) where they bump into the Thing’s son, who is literally the size of a small mountain. Venom then latches onto this colossal thing, and basically makes exactly what you’re looking at here, a fucking giant venom.
2018-09-18 13:00:45 Isn't Venom a baddie?
2018-09-18 13:02:25 Is the Venom inside the Tom Hardy?
2018-09-18 13:10:54 I'm excited. I hope it's great. Maybe if they make a ton of money, they'll decide to do Maximum Carnage.
2018-09-18 13:23:38 Is that Carnage? I think I see Carnage. Please be Carnage.
2018-09-18 13:23:44 Ill wait for the reviews on this one.. 
2018-09-18 13:24:24 What a cluster fuck of a poster. Just show the to main things Tom and venom
2018-09-18 13:25:05 hope it doesn’t suck :/ venom is one of my favorites
2018-09-18 13:27:13 I like the things that are going on in the background
2018-09-18 13:36:43 Knock knock let the devil in!
2018-09-18 13:44:27 Is that Carnage on the bottom left?
2018-09-18 13:45:33 Sony: „Let's create Spiderman universe without Spiderman.” 
2018-09-18 13:46:35 His eye and overall texture look like an egg white that hasn't really cooked very well on the pan. I'm sorry but by the looks of it, this movie is gonna shine and it would probably need 2-3 reboots to do it right. 
2018-09-18 13:51:00 Like a turd in the wind.
2018-09-18 13:53:09 If my preschool daughters catch glimpse of this poster as we see a Rated G movie, they’ll be scarred for life.
2018-09-18 13:56:17 Another movie with tom hardy's face under a mask
2018-09-18 13:59:24 Anyone notice the space ship with "LIFE" on it? Assuming this is an allusion to the writers of the 2017 Life movie that people were saying is a prequel to Venom.
2018-09-18 14:00:38 It's Sony so we know how that's going to turn out.
2018-09-18 14:01:05 Too... Much... Going... On......
Can't... Think..!
2018-09-18 14:02:14 God this looks bad
2018-09-18 14:04:51 Why does this need the Golden gate bridge?
2018-09-18 14:07:05 In the 1920s, Charles A. Ellis said to himself, "I am going to design the greatest movie prop in history!" 85 million dollars plus interest later and whoomp there it is.
2018-09-18 14:07:18 Eyes look like shit.
2018-09-18 14:08:01 looks fan made. poor photoshop compositing.
2018-09-18 14:08:45 No spider man, no care 
2018-09-18 14:13:03 Pg-13. There's your problem.
2018-09-18 14:17:18 Wow I cannot wait!!
2018-09-18 14:26:40 Is this going to be part of the MCU? I’ve been really confused about this for a while.
2018-09-18 14:30:50 I bet Avi Arad is proud
2018-09-18 14:31:06 he looks so bare chested. 
2018-09-18 14:34:48 Ah yes, the venom that has Spider-Man eyes but not Spider-Man symbol a classic.
2018-09-18 14:35:30 Anyone ready to hate this? I want to love it but I know it’ll bomb
2018-09-18 14:36:42 this should be renamed "moron catnip"
2018-09-18 14:40:20 CGI looks shit
2018-09-18 14:40:33 Looka like the poster of a shitty/mediocre fantasy movie based on a moderately succesful book
2018-09-18 14:47:46 Looks like a movie from 2007
2018-09-18 14:50:57 Pretty sure his shoulders aren't that wide in the movie. 


Also the venom here looks more like video game venom than movie cgi venom.  Really off putting. 

False advertising. 
2018-09-18 14:52:03 While I understand why they chose to do it, I think making this movie PG-13 and not R is the reason it will do poorly, for no other reason but the cheesiness factor of having to censor certain things: blood, language, all that stuff. Bummer news, but I’m still going to see it.
2018-09-18 14:52:49 Fuck this is terrible
2018-09-18 14:56:33 Why is he so wet? 
2018-09-18 14:57:44 Its theyre actively flipping us off with this shit. Ima steal it.
2018-09-18 15:03:01 Why does it look so much like the black stuff from spider man? 
2018-09-18 15:03:54 It's like somebody spilled lube all over this movie. 
2018-09-18 15:06:30 When this movie tanks, I hope I see breaking news that Avi Arad is fired from movies, and will never be allowed near anything Spider-Man or Venom related ever again. 
2018-09-18 15:15:56 flop
2018-09-18 15:18:03 For some reason the “Venom” font feels unbalanced and cheap
2018-09-18 15:18:50 He's got that Adrenaline Momentum

Not knowin' when he's

ever gonna slow up in 'em


ready to snap any moment and, um...

this movie's gonna bomb in a second

w-w-when they get bit with the box office numbers
2018-09-18 15:19:21 OMG THIS GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE WOW!!; http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCToOH_NN-uUHxxafLcusJnA
2018-09-18 15:19:59 This is the most PG-13 looking turd I've seen.
2018-09-18 15:22:26 Meh
2018-09-18 15:23:24 BLEEEAAAAAGHHHHH
2018-09-18 15:27:41 At least it's rated pg13 so it has the broadest possible appeal... that way EVERYONE WILL LOVE IT!!!!
2018-09-18 15:28:08 This film will be fucking terrible. 

Tom you can do better
2018-09-18 15:28:40 What is this fucking mask reboot doing here! Gtfo
2018-09-18 15:29:03 "You ain't never had a friend like me!"
2018-09-18 15:30:40 It's OK guys, there's a drone. Kids love drones. 
2018-09-18 15:34:05 18,000 suckers are apparently actually going to give Sony money to be subjected to this mess.

With any luck, 18,000 tickets is all they sell. 
2018-09-18 15:36:53 I’m going to optimistic and say... 55% on Rotten Tomatoes.
2018-09-18 15:37:38 oh boy... this movie looks bad.... I hope it is good.
2018-09-18 15:38:04 meh
2018-09-18 15:38:50 Better secure that poster well or it will blow away like a turd in the wind 
2018-09-18 15:40:30 With the Reddit app I'm using, the preview just showed a horizontal slice of the image with the three characters standing next to each other.  I saw that photoshopped head on the generic 'walking man' body and literally initially thought that it was a parody poster made up by a Redditor.  Nope.  Apparently, that's the real poster.
2018-09-18 15:43:30 Bargain bin
2018-09-18 15:44:42 Why does Tom Hardy look surprised that he's in the movie?
2018-09-18 15:46:39 Im assuming this is a semi autobiographical account of Tom Hardy's early career.
2018-09-18 15:48:22 Up to now I was convincing myself that this was going to be good, but now....I'm worried.
2018-09-18 15:51:57 Damn I hate these types of posters
2018-09-18 15:52:19 That is a bizarre and bad trailer. 
2018-09-18 15:52:32 I actually had high hopes...
2018-09-18 15:54:14 I think Insomniac Games would make a better Venom movie
2018-09-18 15:55:32 Movie looks like shit and I don't like the way Eddie Brock was portrayed. Nothing against Tom Hardy, just bad writing
2018-09-18 15:55:36 That looks SICK!

2018-09-18 15:55:57 Pg - 13

No thanks 
2018-09-18 15:58:32 just so everybody knows - the golden gate bridge is in this film.
2018-09-18 15:59:18 Can't be worse than Spiderman 3.... right guys?
2018-09-18 15:59:28 How the fucking hell did they manage to make a Venom movie poster look this bland? Venom has some of the most iconic artwork and comic covers of all time.....
2018-09-18 16:03:34 Is this a sequel to Alien: Covenant?
2018-09-18 16:06:17 That's a big guy. 
2018-09-18 16:08:16 A drone shining a spotlight is no where as cool or intimidating looking as a helicopter.
2018-09-18 16:09:11 Ugh, someone left trash on Reddit's hot page
2018-09-18 16:11:43 Lol this movie is gonna be so bad
2018-09-18 16:13:16 Have you seen [Upgrade](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6499752)? It's a different kind of symbiosis (human + machine AI) with a male lead that's strikingly similar to Tom Hardy. Really good movie... 
2018-09-18 16:13:42 [Spot the differences](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTMyMDA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY5NTkzNTE@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,674,1000_AL_.jpg)
2018-09-18 16:15:22 I'm worried that this is going to end up being a really bad version on Upgrade...
2018-09-18 16:15:32 Proof positive that I will watch any trash that has Tom Hardy in it. 
2018-09-18 16:18:24 I can't wait to watch this 
2018-09-18 16:20:50 There’s too much going on. Should have went with a simpler look- I’m thinking like the cover to the Spider-Man:The Movie video game. https://www.lukiegames.com/Spiderman-Sony-Playstation-2-PS2-Game.html
 
Marketing is revealing too much, like I kinda don’t care to see it now. They should have limited Venom’s look in the trailers, especially this poster
2018-09-18 16:27:48 I just want to know how they are going to explain why Venom looks like spiderman. 
2018-09-18 16:32:32 As soon as we saw this was PG-13 we knew we were in for a flop.

RIP the potential of an excellent venom movie 
2018-09-18 17:16:30 Sooooo, not sure this is the correct place to ask this, but, does anyone remember the actual origins of Venom? Marvel Comics “Secret Wars”. I grew up reading Marvel comics and was so stoked for the Venom addition to an otherwise watered down Spiderman universe. Then Hollywood got ahold of him and... well... I really feel that justice has not been served in regards to the potential awesomeness that A Venom movie could be. 
2018-09-18 17:17:36 The symbiote fight in the lower left just looks like Bert and Ernie with their flesh ripped off
2018-09-18 17:19:32 It's going to suck so bad
2018-09-18 17:30:21 I know it's dumb to say certain movies should be rated R, but come on.
2018-09-18 17:30:53 I really want to be excited, but every trailer has looked like trash so far.
2018-09-18 17:52:37 Who asked for this movie to be made? The oversaturation of the Spider-Man universe is annoying. 
2018-09-18 17:56:09 This just looks weird. 
2018-09-18 18:13:57 Whoa Bane is Venom! Sweet!
2018-09-18 18:33:31 I'm really looking forward to not being able to tell what in the hell Tom Hardy is talking about in this film.
2018-09-18 18:44:39 They did nail the Venom look here...but its still gonna be garbage
2018-09-18 18:45:57 I would love this to be good, but my hopes are not high. That said, how about a post credit teaser where Venom has a run in with Spider-Man and all those veins morph into the spider.
2018-09-18 18:48:50 I'm so apprehensive about this.

I don't think Hollywood is good at depicting superheroes/supervillains the same way that the people who read the comics and watched the cartoons do.

How many movies have been made about superheroes and how many actually met your expectations.  

For me, the ratio is horrendously low.
2018-09-18 19:00:09 This looks like a shitty photoshop
2018-09-18 19:02:25 ITT: cuts down fox, gives all their money to disney
2018-09-18 19:29:31 I’ll probably go see it just to get a glimpse of Carnage since they’re hasn’t been a sign of him in any trailer yet.
2018-09-18 19:31:54 I hate the font for 'Venom' something about it doesn't look right 
2018-09-18 20:33:50 "But can we make it more busy?"
2018-09-18 20:57:19 wow i can't wait for this years suicide squad
2018-09-18 20:58:49 I am going to watch the movie even if it gets bad reviews. I mean it probably will but I hope it at least has some good fight scenes.
2018-09-18 21:11:20 Glad I'm not the only one who thought this looks like absolute dogshit. How can promotional material reduce any existing anticipation?
2018-09-18 21:14:11 The retouching on this poster sucks balls 
2018-09-18 21:34:21 Not a good sign that even the poster has too much shit shoved in it
2018-09-18 21:42:37 fucking yikes
2018-09-18 22:00:26 No need to see it, they showed everything in the trailer. 
2018-09-18 22:02:33 Is it just me or is Riz Ahmed in everything nowadays? He does okay, but I don’t get why he’s  such wanted talent.
Good for him though.
2018-09-18 22:08:42 They could've gone with something original or stylish. But no, it had to be a "main cast standing next to each other, plus some random bg junk" cover...
2018-09-18 22:20:44 Look like "Super Natural" fan art
2018-09-18 22:48:40 No matter how bad or good this movie is one things for sure, that Venom looks fucking amazing, 10/10, they nailed Venom.
2018-09-18 23:32:58 Wow, just look at *how super excited you all are* for this garbage.
2018-09-19 00:26:26 Batting 0/2 in the Eddie Brock actor department.  Tom Hardy is going to be as bad as Topher Grace.  A different kind of bad, but still bad.

I'm ashamed to say I'm still going to see it.  Might wait for half-price Tuesday though.
2018-09-19 01:43:13 Marvel properties outside of the MCU are just meh.

Edit: I forgot about Deadpool and Logan. I thought those were very good. 
2018-09-19 02:54:33 I feel like this was already released and was out of the theater in 2 weeks due to major suckage 

Still got mad love for Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams but could not be interested in seeing this
2018-09-19 04:24:25 I'm honestly impressed it looks this generic and bland. This is the kind of poster that belongs to 2007, like it could have come out immediately after Spider-Man 3 and people would be able to tell the difference.
2018-09-19 04:30:00 So... can anyone explain why there’s 3 great actors on this poster who are inexplicably wasting their time on this definitely terrible movie?
2018-09-19 04:53:56 I'm a little nervous now that it has been confirmed to be PG-13 rather than R but I'll hold out until the movie actually comes out,if it turns out great then the Spiderman 3 version will be forgiven......mostly
2018-09-19 07:01:44 "vnmmmmmm vnm vnm vnmmmmmm" - eminem
2018-09-19 18:20:16 Yuck. 
2018-09-19 19:11:43 Why does that landing pod have 'LIFE' written on it? Sequel to 'LIFE' the movie confirmed? 
2018-09-20 01:45:16 This is going to be the most "5.4 on imdb" movie ever.
2018-09-20 21:45:30 Looking at the ship on the left side of the poster, I wonder what the significance is? The symbiote crash is on the opposite side. Reverse engineering or something else? 
2018-10-12 06:22:38 Such a badass poster 
2018-09-18 05:18:02 Where's that nice and safe PG-13 label. 
2018-09-18 05:14:30 Yikes... this is pretty bad.
2018-09-17 23:19:30 [deleted]
2018-09-18 01:41:43 "Coming Soon" they couldn't just write in the release date?
2018-09-18 06:02:24 Its only missing a massive “PG-13” logo in blinking lights. 
2018-09-18 00:18:25 This is a pretty rad poster. I can't wait for October 5th! :D
2018-09-18 03:42:51 PG-13, will be garbage. 
2018-09-18 00:48:53 Fucking cool
2018-09-18 01:03:46 looks just as bad as the first poster
2018-09-18 01:34:15 Hahaha, well you know, I’ll see it regardless. Can’t be worse than The Predator.
2018-09-18 02:00:48 I can’t wait for the reboot when Sony sells the rights to Marvel!
2018-09-18 03:30:41 So awful.
2018-09-18 04:56:23 You know when you can just tell a movie is going to be awful from the poster? Sigh.
2018-09-18 05:00:03 Poor Venom :/
2018-09-18 05:21:11 As soon as I heard “sim bye oat” in the trailer, I knew this would be bad.  
2018-09-18 05:45:11 Tom in "Hardly Venom".  Rated PG-13
2018-09-18 07:14:23 Topher is the one true Venom
2018-09-18 00:35:42 Is the guy on the left the guy from American Pie that dates Tara Reid?
2018-09-18 00:35:58 Another shitty poster made by 5 year old employees by Sony....
2018-09-18 00:39:01 Sometimes less is more, when did movie posters get so busy?
That said Venom looks pretty great on it 
2018-09-18 00:47:12 Was there ever any confirmation of the movie *Life* being connected to this film?
2018-09-18 01:26:59 Can someone Photoshop it to remove the txt at the bottom? 
2018-09-18 01:58:56 Sony learn from DC, don’t desaturate your colors just because it’s a dark movie. 
2018-09-18 02:01:35 That's a lot of effort to appeal to a 12-year-old me who just doesn't give a shit.
2018-09-18 02:07:37 Ugh there really isn’t going to be a spider on his chest is there
2018-09-18 02:23:01 Riz’s character motivations are the same as dr Connors from tasm1, I get the feeling his character is poorly written 
2018-09-18 02:24:45 I'm getting Mummy flashbacks.
2018-09-18 03:29:19 Shocking how they actually nailed his look.
2018-09-18 03:33:49 Thanks, I hate it.
2018-09-18 03:39:15 While I would gladly allow Tom hardy or Venom to drag their balls accross my face, this movie makes me very uneasy. 
2018-09-18 03:40:58 I just wish we could have got the spider symbol. It is such a cool look and neither film featuring Venom have had it. It would have been so cool to have it be a suit from when Spiderman was in space but I realize rights and such.... 
2018-09-18 04:19:22 Are they trying to fit the entire movie's plot into the poster?

&#x200B;

Just have Venom's face on the poster, 'nuff said...
2018-09-18 04:26:18 The way it's designed, this might as well be a Harry Potter movie poster. I wanted to see a Venom movie for so long during the early Spider Man movie days. Now I don't even care. It looks so generic and soulless that I'm not even interested. The casting and dialogue already seem like trash and the art direction is bland. I was hoping for something dark, gritty, and evil with something meaningful behind it. This just looks like a low-effort, boring, and rushed action flick to appease casual movie-goers. 
2018-09-18 05:22:27 Hahaha this looks like utter shit lol. Good for Tom and anyone who got a nice payday though! Hopefully the movie still tanks
2018-09-18 05:48:17 Eyy where Spiderman ?
2018-09-18 05:51:04 Is there any chance this movie is good?
2018-09-18 05:57:33 So what’s the premise of this movie since spidey isn’t involved?
2018-09-18 06:30:00 Hey screw yall I really like this poster
2018-09-18 07:15:22 PG-13 rating removed most of my hype unfortunately. 
2018-09-18 07:17:34 Spiderman is in New York and Venom is in San Francisco?
2018-09-18 07:19:49 The biggest red flag other than is a Sony Movie is that they made it PG13 but market it like it’s rated R so they have more audience member that might see it.

Deadpool didn’t have that problem because it’s R rating was appealing to adults. We wanted an adult superhero movie with intense violence. Logan is another great example. It seems forced when you make a movie exclusively about venom and it’s not rated R.

PG13 horror doesn’t work. It’s all just bloodless violence. 
2018-09-18 07:21:34 “Am I the only one impressed by-“

*zooms in*

“Oh”
2018-09-18 07:27:47 Congratulations to Marvel on the release of their first DCU movie!
2018-09-18 07:31:16 Surprised to see so many people trashing the poster, I think it looks better than the majority of MCU posters. Definitely beats the DCEU posters so far. 
2018-09-18 07:33:43 Uggh, as soon as I heard pg13 I immediately lost interest. 
2018-09-18 07:37:06 *Sigh*

...this movie is gonna suck.

2018-09-18 08:11:01 I just feel like it's going to be a steaming pile of shit... Still gunna see it opening day though.
2018-09-18 08:19:25 Are we still holding out hope that this thing ain't going to be a steaming pile?
2018-09-18 08:21:30 I can't wait for how terrible this is going to be
2018-09-18 08:24:25 Genuinely surprised Tom took a part in it.

Sony must have offered him absolutely a shitload.
2018-09-18 08:36:45 Would have done 10000000 times better in the MCU.
2018-09-18 08:37:18 so rated r or still not rated yet? i feel like its gonna be pg13
2018-09-18 09:35:32 Hey have any of you negative losers entertained the thought it might be ok? I can’t wait to see “thought it would be Garbo, actually might be ok.” Fucking losers 
2018-09-18 09:40:49 I know Tom Holland is gonna be in this. We all do. Just put him on the poster man!

2018-09-18 10:33:27 I just hope they won't give up the character even if it bombs.
2018-09-18 10:34:25 Why is there so much negativity against this film?
2018-09-18 10:34:39 I dig it
2018-09-18 12:24:48 Me after first venom announcement "Tom hardy doesn't seem to look like a good Eddie Brock and i have a very strong feeling this is going to be a garbage movie" 

Everyone of my friends and everyone online "you're a dumb DC fanboy who hates everything Marvel and you're upset that Tom Hardy is going to be a better Venom than Bane" 

Me after multiple trailers "the CGI looks bad and i don't see a great script coming out of this" 

Everyone" that's just test footage, that won't be used in the final cut, this movie's going to be so good and so badass" 

Me" I still feel like this might be bad movie but I don't hope for it" 

Everyone" We knew from the beginning that this film was going to be a dud and all it will do is put a worse name on the spiderman franchise!

Me"...*sigh*"

edit: I fucking hate cash grabs like this so much. fuck whoever made it
2018-09-18 13:11:47 This movie got a PG 13 rating there's no way this film isn't trash.   What the fuck, PG 13 for Venom?  That's so fucking lame.  
2018-09-18 13:20:27 The font on 'Venom' looks like it should be on the poster for a teen summer adventure movie or something. I'm not sure if I'm splitting hairs here but it looks so out of place to me
2018-09-18 13:20:29 God this film is going to suck...
2018-09-18 13:41:14 Crap

Crap

Mega crap
2018-09-18 23:16:47 The first trailer cemented my opinion that this will be a steaming pile of shit.
2018-09-17 23:20:04 Cant wait to see current spiderman fight venom 
2018-09-18 00:34:06 Fucking disgusting 
2018-09-18 02:31:42 Gosh, not even the Marvel upvote bots are upvoting this one
2018-09-18 03:42:14 This looks terrible. 
2018-09-18 04:49:46 Garbage
2018-09-18 05:10:30 ugly turd
2018-09-18 00:50:32 fuck this movie
2018-09-18 05:16:29 Spider-Man 3 was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw after my mom found it in a bargain bin. Tobey Maguire was the first celebrity crush I remember having. And Venom will forever be *the* big bad in my mind. A demon, ghost, spook, or zombie will never be as scary as what my 8 year old mind twisted Venom into. A black mass, twisted and hiding in corners, waiting to launch out and devour me. Every dark spot in my house caused me to run in terror. I slept with a night light until middle school. 

And I'm going to love this movie. 

It doesn't matter if it's shit. Hell, I think I'll like it more if it's shit. It'll be a triumph in my mind, a stomping down of a childhood demon. I can imagine my tiny self screaming in terror at the poop jokes, and hiding in my mother's skirts. But I'll never be properly scared of it. Not anymore. Now that I've grown to see the horrors the world has, and I've seen a superhero movie done right, I can greet my demon with open arms. 

I'm counting the days. Bring it on, Venom, I've got a score to settle.
2018-09-18 02:08:12 Upside: There won't likely be another attempt at a Venom movie.

(I accept the downvotes.)
2018-09-18 03:21:54 Its like this movie is being purposefully designed to fail or something. Everything weve been shown ranges between terrible or utterly bland. The whole thing is so bizarre and forced you have to wonder what the people in charge at Sony are thinking.
2018-09-18 04:49:24 I’m actually pumped for the part of the movie where venom is going ape shit through the city and it goes to a shot of venom on the top of a building facing out over the city and Eminem’s Venom chorus comes in with murderous amounts of bass
2018-09-18 04:57:06 Another Super Hero movie...
2018-09-18 05:39:00 PG13 piece of shit
2018-09-18 07:11:02 This is a movie that in all honesty should never have been made. Venom is a two-bit character at best. Why would anyone be into seeing this?
2018-09-18 00:46:22 Can’t believe it’s PG-13. It had so much potential to be the first MCU rated-R movie.
2018-09-18 01:31:18 His eyes look like cum.
2018-09-18 02:49:04 The marvel magazine original history ist an infection from a rare sustance in a mission to the moon wen the tripulations came back to the earth  the rare substance take dna from spider man and and infect a man so its was the born of venom
2018-09-18 03:25:38 Heard it was rated for ages 13. At that point I knew this was not worth watching. Needed an 18 rating like Logan.
2018-09-18 01:28:59 Looks good
2018-09-18 02:34:47 Movie will suck 
2018-09-18 02:37:23 So many MCU fanboys in this comment section, r/movies has just become and MCU circlejerk
2018-09-18 02:39:08 Ever since I heard new Eminem in the new trailer my expectations have plummeted to a realistic low.
2018-09-18 02:44:32 The more I see the cgi venom the less I like how he looks
2018-09-18 02:44:41 Jesus Christ, there is so much going on in this poster.
2018-09-18 02:45:31 That actress sure is in this movie I’ll tell you.
2018-09-18 02:50:52 Maybe gets defeated by sonic the hedgehog?
2018-09-18 02:54:42 Pass. No spidey, no likey. 
2018-09-18 03:00:53 Why are they making a Venom movie outside of the MCU? 


2018-09-18 03:04:22 What were they even trying to do with this poster? It seems like they took several different ideas and just mashed them together with no concern about any sort of cohesiveness. 
2018-09-18 03:44:25 Ah. You smell that? Turds.

I love the smell of turds in the wind.
2018-09-18 03:46:58 The font they chose for the words "Venom" make it look like a Disney magic castle style movie. 
2018-09-18 03:50:44 Boooooooooo
2018-09-18 03:51:46 [Fixed it](https://imgur.com/a/2fb4n42)
2018-09-18 03:52:52 PG-13.
2018-09-18 03:53:05 looks like Tom Hardy is a stand user
2018-09-18 04:09:09 Was excited until I saw the most recent trailer and the pg13 rating. 
I was also disappointed that Hardy took the role. I really wanted him as the next wolverine.
2018-09-18 04:11:35 Looks bad. Like Garfield Spiderman bad 
2018-09-18 04:12:48 Looks dreadful. 
2018-09-18 04:14:14 This movie is going to be terrible....I'll still be watching it. 
Also Hardy should have been the new wolverine 
2018-09-18 04:16:44 Jesus that is a busy poster. I can't believe it's official, I've seen like four waaay better fan made on the marvel sub


2018-09-18 04:16:55 Poster made the movie look so much worse 
2018-09-18 04:24:29 I feel bad for Tom Hardy having to be attached to this dumpster fire.
2018-09-18 04:28:43 PG13 yikes
2018-09-18 04:32:09 This movie will have more Tom Hardy facetime then Venom time and that's exactly why movies like this fail.
2018-09-18 04:35:45 Lol, the shuttle says Life.  Subtle fan service.
2018-09-18 04:38:06 Venom looks cool, hardy looks suave..the villian?? Umm...no. that's like eddie brock spiderman 3 casting..
2018-09-18 04:39:00 Cool poster but......... still looks bad :-/
2018-09-18 04:44:43 So who's going to be the antagonist in this? Or is he just going to fight version of - yawn - himself?
2018-09-18 04:45:48 Looks like they're ripping a page out of those live-action Japanese movie posters.
2018-09-18 04:46:51 Pg-13, like i always dreamed
2018-09-18 04:49:49 Too bad it’s pg-13. 
2018-09-18 04:52:21 Yikes that is not a good poster. Symbiote isn’t even sticking to Hardy, it looks like it’s hovering above...
2018-09-18 05:04:29 Oooh, another superhero-movie, just what was needed to make me go back to the cinema. [/sarcasm]
2018-09-18 05:11:35 Im excited for this movie, not so much about this poster
2018-09-18 05:12:17 PG 13 should be in big ol letters somewhere
2018-09-18 05:22:39 PG-13 meh
2018-09-18 05:37:41 Saw the full trailer today, damm Venom looks awesome.  

I have high hopes but low expectations.
2018-09-18 07:16:47 I honestly cannot wait for this shit to hit digital distribution so I can MST3k it with my friends.
2018-09-18 07:41:05 So late 2000’s superheroie 
2018-09-18 08:26:12 Michelle Williams ruining another show that would have been great.
2018-09-18 12:01:31 This looks like it's going to be a limited run series on the CW. Just feels so cheap. 
2018-09-18 12:02:03 This is great, a good design for venom and some of the best CGI i've seen for the year 1998!

2018-09-18 13:07:53 Not bad. Not very good though, looks very photoshopped.
2018-09-18 13:44:30 The poster is the same colour of the bile I vomited looking at it.
2018-09-18 14:14:42 Yeah, not feelin it.. Tom Hardy needs to stick to British ganstar
2018-09-18 15:32:26 Needs more Topher Grace. 
2018-09-18 15:43:43 It's pg 13. They can suck a di^iiii^^iiiick
2018-09-18 16:29:52 The CGI of the suit reminds me of the Spawn live action movie. 
2018-09-18 20:15:32 I wish this was R-rated.

I don't think I'll watch it as I hear it's going to be PG13 :/
2018-09-18 20:46:29 There is no difference between tv programmes and cinematic releases anymore. Why should anyone pay £20 to see something like this once at the cinema when the same poor quality acting, direction and effects can get you the same at home for less than this junk.

Production houses need to start giving everyone a good reason to head to the cinema or they’ll start missing out financially. 




2018-09-18 23:16:01 Hardy's voice as Brock just sounds childish and retarded, Im not sure Ill be able to see past it.
2018-09-18 02:37:21 This looks like an ad for a CTV network show. 
2018-09-18 02:57:32 Shouldn't the poster be a picture of cold diarreah in a dixie cup?
2018-09-18 03:20:28 I'm not sure I'm edgy enough to watch this movie
2018-09-18 03:23:58 This feels like they pussed out and had to "play it safe" even though doing that this many years into the superhero movie phenomenon is commercial suicide.

2018-09-18 03:53:16 Lol does anyone actually want this movie?
2018-09-18 03:57:40 Get that PG-13 bullshit outta my face!
2018-09-18 03:59:33 Everything about this movie looks terrible, i cant believe people think this is in the mcu
2018-09-18 04:01:55 get ready for another pg-13 mess
2018-09-18 04:11:03 This is going to suck, huh?
2018-09-18 04:20:45 I still dont understand why hes in san francisco and not nyc
2018-09-18 07:23:26 Venom is my persona on the mat.
2018-09-18 08:06:51 #WE-ARE-VENOM
2018-09-18 09:13:48 I work in a weld shop. Venom's skin has the same colour and texture as my snot when i blow my nose after my shift  
2018-09-18 13:29:09 this is gonna be awful isn't it?
2018-10-02 21:45:00 And to address why we haven't allowed the social media reactions, remember **we don't allow social media reactions for any movie ever.** They are always skewed and very rarely negative, this being one of the few examples. That's why companies pre select people they know will be more favorable to them, because they know they will give it a positive spin before the bad reviews come out.

As for this story it does break our rules about celebrity reactions and no one posted it with just facts and not memes and nonsense. So here it is.

Third there will be a review megathread at 9:30cst when the fully written reviews come out.

Fourth, come on guys. You knew this movie would be shitty. It looked shitty from the beginning. If you were hyped you were duped

Fifth, for those calling us Sony shills, we are obviously Disney shills and have been from the beginning. /s(?)

Thanks.
2018-10-02 22:40:17 I heard it was mostly just him solving crime followed by full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Full penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends.
2018-10-02 22:27:46 I love when the excuses start before the movie is released. 
2018-10-03 02:45:10 Turns out it's just the line "turd in the wind" and then a 39 minute, 57 second pause to allow for audience laughter to die down.
2018-10-02 22:28:06 
>And to address why we haven't allowed the social media reactions, remember **we don't allow social media reactions for any movie ever.**

What about this one from [Sicario 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8r77l1/sicario_2_social_media_embargo_is_off_now/)
Or this one for [Dunkirk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6mfsxm/dunkirk_social_media_megathread/)
Or this one for [Alien: Covenant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69anyb/alien_covenant_premiere_reactions/)


Edit: looks like they removed the posts lol


Edit 2: And just for the fuck of it since it’s so easy to literally just type “early reactions” in the search bar, here’s an early reaction thread for [Annihilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7w1zg6/annihilation_first_reactions/) , [Age of Ultron](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/322eac/avengers_age_of_ultron_early_buzz_read_the_first/) and [PotC: Dead Men Tell No Tales](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6251b8/pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales/).
2018-10-02 21:43:24 12th time's the charm.
2018-10-03 00:13:56 Lol I feel pretty bad for the dude from Comics Explained. He covers comics on YouTube and is really good at it. Sony contacted him about asking a few questions and basically covering the movie. He literally asked like 4 questions, and if you watch the video he and the guys were having a good time. I bet he fe feels terrible for having caused so much trouble for Tom Hardy. He seems like such a fan boy at heart and just wanted to meet some famous people. 

Edit: Rob posted a new video 4 hours ago going over the interview and his POV about it.

2018-10-02 21:57:00 Gameinformer says Tom hardy favorite scenes were cut so it's not missleading

2018-10-03 01:45:57 Man, he must really hate Anchorman, they had enough leftover material to create a 2nd unofficial movie
2018-10-03 03:51:25 I dont understand Hollywood anymore.  It's almost like the people in charge there are old farts who have no clue how to look at recent data such as Deadpool and Logan.  Both were hard R rated films that did very well at the box office due to their rating and violent content.  If you ask me what comes to mind first when I think of Venom, it is that he is the most violent superhero/villan I can think of in the Marvel universe from when I was a kid.  Having this movie be PG-13 will be a colossal mistake that the studio is going to regret.
2018-10-02 22:09:56 How very Josh Trank of him to say so.
2018-10-02 22:16:08 well, good thing i lost interest in this movie once it was rated PG-13

Yaaay
2018-10-03 02:50:20 Always a good sign when the lead role makes excuses before the film is even premiered. Saddle up, we're in fer an ol fashioned shitshow, boys.
2018-10-03 00:57:05 The context of the quote in the article says the scenes cut were his favorite. Why twist this post title ever so slightly to be less damning? 

40 minutes cut? Not news. 
40 minutes of Tom Hardy's favorite scenes cut? Bad Sony PR. Not playing nice. 
2018-10-02 23:47:33 > I feel like we don't compromise Venom in any real way.

Except for the fact that his entire existence is based upon a premise that doesn't exist in the movie.

Venom was born from the hatred Eddie Brock has for Peter Parker for destroying his career and the Symbiote's hate of Spider-Man for rejecting their bond.

I'll go see it anyway.

2018-10-03 03:00:01 Heard this movie is Catwoman bad. I’m scared 
2018-10-02 22:08:44 He also said he hated doing Mad Max and that he didn’t understand anything that was going on throughout the entirety of filming. So, take it with a grain of salt. 
2018-10-03 00:53:41 Venom is a 1:52 movie.  

What were they going to do? Turn this into a 2:30 movie? 
2018-10-03 08:17:45 If you're Tom Hardy, you should have never signed on to this knowing that it wasn't part of the MCU and had nothing to do with Spiderman.  Dumb move on his part.  I can't say I have any sympathy.  

Fans look at this shit and will go "Oh hell yeah, TOM HARDY is cast.  Even if the movie sucks, he'll carry it it because he's TOM HARDY.  He can't possibly be in a piece of shit movie!" and they're the same people who said the same thing about Shane Black writing and directing the Predator.

2018-10-02 23:22:18 well that's called editing
2018-10-02 23:32:34 Ok, so 40 minutes of content was cut. Not shocking, most films cut content for various reasons, sometimes cutting several hours of footage. 

Tom Hardy says they were his favorite scenes and that they were mad puppeteering, dark comedy, etc. That's also not shocking. It sounds like these were experimental scenes where the cast could pick a gag and just run with it, do some interesting improv, and stretch the limits of their characters. They probably were pretty fun to film, but were cut from the main film as filler. 

Some of it will probably end up in a director's cut, which might make the movie a bit better but probably won't make or break the film. 
2018-10-02 22:23:50 Around 30-40 minutes is cut from any big blockbuster like this. Its the nature of the process.
2018-10-03 01:11:52 If I was a volunteer mod (As they all are) you guys better believe if Sony paid me a bag of money to delete your retarded non sense I would do it without so much as a breath of thought. 

It would be the easiest decision I ever made in my life.
2018-10-03 02:04:03 I'm starting a petition for the snyder cut.
2018-10-03 11:33:24 Idc

The biggest fucking mistake was making a Venom movie pg 13. 
Especially when the most successful comic movies are rated R, Deadpool/wolverine.
This knobhead trying to justify making it pg 13 just irritates me and I wouldn’t doubt that Tom didn’t even know about the cut scenes until the movie hit the screens. He’s probably upset and this movie is probably gonna be a disappointment just like the usual/common sony product. 
2018-10-03 08:27:48 “We only ever talked about this movie as being PG-13," director Ruben Fleisher added”

That’s fucking bullshit, they said it would be R at its first Comic-Con 
2018-10-02 21:44:29 All movies have cut content. The original cut of Rambo was over 3 hours long.
2018-10-03 02:04:18 I remember he did some live reveal that he was going to be Venom at some kind of comic event (not comic con, but maybe) and was also on YouTube. He got the crowd all hyped and said how much he loved Venom and that he was going to make sure that they make the best Venom movie possible. I wonder if that was all bullshit or if it just fell apart.
2018-10-03 12:43:07 Please for the love of Stan Lee.. SONY, LET GO OF THE SPIDERMAN FRANCHISE.
2018-10-04 01:46:54 They used Batman as a model for making a Venom movie?

Batman, a hero who doesn't kill as a model for Venom, an anti-hero who actually does kill his opponents pretty brutally? 

The movie was destined to fail. The model for Venom should have been Deadpool (hard R, dark comedy). 


The roadmap was there and they decided to just ignore it. 


Oh well. 
2018-10-03 03:47:58 They should have cut the remaining 130 minutes 
2018-10-02 22:02:31 And the reviews are all shit right? 
2018-10-02 23:26:27 Wasn't this information released a day or two ago? 
2018-10-02 23:29:53 Do you have to install a rootkit to see the movie?
2018-10-03 03:59:44 he said his *favorite* 40 minutes were cut. How could the title ommit that, it's the key word.
2018-10-03 04:25:15 Tom covering his ass 
2018-10-03 10:42:32 Recutting this to PG-13 was a big mistake. I just don't understand why would Sony announce the film would be R, hire a director who has only made R-rated films so far, and then cop out and water it down.

Logan was a hit. Both Deadpool films made huge profits. This is proof that yes, R-rated comic book films can generate big bucks at the box office while sticking to the intentional mature tone of the source material. I'm sure Venom will make money, but definitely not as much if it was in its original state.

If a director's cut is released, it would probably outgross the studio version.
2018-10-03 14:40:15 Here we go. God fucking dammit 
2018-10-03 02:16:13 Wanna bet there's a "Director's Cut" that will be released to show the "original" vision?
2018-10-03 03:18:28 "We only ever talked about this movie as being PG-13,"

I guess the director has some short term memory issues.
2018-10-03 03:49:43 Mods are control freaks everywhere on reddit, they make their silly rules and even if you follow them all they find another excuse to abuse their authority. This is what happens when small people are put into big shoes, the moment they get a taste of control over others, they start acting like fucking fascists.
2018-10-03 00:03:20 Well yeah, that's what happens when you edit movies
2018-10-03 01:41:40 Here we go again
2018-10-03 03:45:40 He complains about almost every movie he’s in 
2018-10-03 16:30:28 Tom Hardy has to got to be a PR manager's nightmare, lol

Dude will say literally whatever whenever with no regard for anything but his own opinion.
2018-10-04 05:09:25 Was it the good 40 minutes?
2018-10-02 21:42:37 And thus the cycle continues. Might aswel give up mods once something is released to the internet you can't stop ot.
2018-10-02 21:44:57 AKA if this film tanks at the box office it's due to the fact that 40 minutes were cut AKA the talent is getting ready to point the fingers at the studio AKA he didn't like what he saw in a private screening of the film.
2018-10-03 05:46:14 "I feel like we don't compromise Venom in any real way. He's as aggressive as fans could possibly hope for, I think."

-Ruben Fleischer, director

That's not a quote from a director who's certain people will love the film. I smell producer meddling just like we've seen from so many DC movies. This movie is also only in the MCU if it does well, it seems.
2018-10-03 07:51:34 You know who'd probably make a great R rated venom movie? Sam Raimi.
2018-10-03 07:24:35 After what Sony did to The Dark Tower I wouldn't be surprised if they cut all the good parts and released a turd. I mean they already ruined a movie with 7 books of source material and two of the best actors in the business.
2018-10-03 09:10:59 Sim Bye Oat
2018-10-03 12:03:38 These studios really hate making good movies, don't they?

2018-10-03 01:27:27 My hype died as soon as I heard the horrible voice they gave Venom. Sounds like late ‘90s-early 2000s level of effort. 
2018-10-03 01:13:31 > Fifth, for those calling us Sony shills...

2018-10-03 02:03:13 Misleading OP, the articles title is "Tom Hardy Says His Favourite 40 Minutes Of 'Venom' Were Cut From Film".
2018-10-03 02:27:27 Sony should sell the ips back to Marvel. Enough of their crappy movies. Rather have Venom done by Marvel and have it part of the Marvel cinematic universe.
2018-10-03 07:26:47 Sony

# ITS TIME. TO STOP.
2018-10-03 07:32:47 Get ready for Sony to Sony it all up. 
2018-10-03 11:07:54 Just sell spidermam to disney or let marvel make movies and you distribute/pay them. 

Sony would have actual good movies then
2018-10-02 22:39:30 /r/movies sucks lately, all you guys want to do is bitch and moan about something you haven't even seen yet. I'll never understand you guys wanting something to fail.
2018-10-02 22:21:07 I blame the Russians 
2018-10-03 07:19:54 Spin mode: Activated!
2018-10-03 08:21:44 Hopefully we’ll get a directors cut or an unrated cut of venom. I wanna see the real movie not the pg-13 reshot version. 
2018-10-03 10:02:57 Dont worry Tom I'll just pirate your shitty movie....no plans on paying hard earned money to see this disaster
2018-10-02 22:03:06 I’m excited for this movie !!!
2018-10-03 03:42:15 Hopefully it doesn't suck. What he said was that they were his favorite scenes to film. He said it's her playfully like he had fun doing it and was disappointed they didn't make the cut. I don't think his comment was as negative as it's being interpreted.
2018-10-03 04:32:20 He might be right, and they might be his favorite scenes, but this isn't uncommon. What this sounds like is Tom knowing, or getting out in front of, the film doing poorly. This will cause people who did like the film to say Sony didn't give it a fair shake and then a "Release the Hardy cut!" hashtag will start on Twitter...just like with Justice League. 
2018-10-03 04:56:03 When studios let actors promote their movies
2018-10-03 05:12:20 Quick, see if they can cut an hour and fifty more!
2018-10-03 05:13:17 Release the Snyder cut!
2018-10-03 10:33:11 So we're gonna get an extended cut? Why not? 
2018-10-03 11:55:02 You know a film is bad when the main star is shouting from the rooftops about how much of the film was changed or dropped unexpectedly.
2018-10-03 13:04:13 Get back to Taboo Hardy, right now.... We have a use for you....
2018-10-05 00:01:51 If even Tom Hardy has issues with the final cut, I’d like to make a call for the uncut venom to be released!
2018-10-05 00:21:20 Uncut venom should be released! #uncutvenom (In my opinion I’d just love to see it)

2018-10-03 07:56:22 Why does everyone so desperately want this to be bad? I hope its good. Love venom. The voice seems spot on too. 
2018-10-03 09:13:04 Great, one more reason to not go see it
2018-10-03 09:33:50 So he's already making excuses for why it's going to be bad.
2018-10-03 09:43:22 So BluRay out soon? 
2018-10-03 11:08:02 This is code for "lol I did a shit movie." 
2018-10-03 01:21:32 I fully expect the movie to suck.  Reviews out yet?

2018-10-03 02:14:57 People saying "durr hurr they cut footage from all movies"

that isn't the point being made by Tom. He's saying that HIS FAVORITE PERFORMANCES were cut. He does not agree with what was cut, not that anything was cut at all. Please know the difference before you open your shishka mouths.
2018-10-02 23:34:35 Potentially good, it means a probably bad movie will be an actually bad movie but short. 

Honestly the only movies I’ve been interested in lately are Halloween which looks amazing despite being Blumhouse (I know they make more than bad movies, but I have a low opinion of most of their horror movies), and Bad Times at the El Royale which I only heard about recently and looks interesting. 

Venom has been off my list for a *long* time now. So this change means little for me
2018-10-03 00:09:31 Is’t it  normal in film industry to cut part of a movie ?
2018-10-03 00:30:38 Literally just a few days ago, the "Blade Runner 2049 edit talks 4 hour cut of the film". That movie ended up being 2 hours 45 minutes. Why is everyone freaking out about this? Shit gets cut out of movies. It's not a big deal
2018-10-03 00:34:57 I've seen the videos of Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed doing all those promotional fun YouTube videos with Jimmy Fallon and all these other magazines, and in my opinion, they should just stop. The film's a trainwreck and I don't think they want to promote such a film, as both are clearly fantastic actors.

Tom Hardy clearly isn't afraid to speak his own opinion, and by saying that his favourite 40 minutes were cut, is essentially saying that this movie is bad.
2018-10-03 01:33:15 #RELEASE THE HARDY CUT
2018-10-03 01:51:31 The haters are hating just because Venom is black. 

####blacklivesmatter
2018-10-03 01:58:31 The editors were trying to spare us from more pain.
2018-10-03 02:06:01 Come on, it was obvious from the start since Venom was first announced that this movie wasn't going to work and it was only made purely for a greedy cash grab because they wanted the big money like the MCU. If Sony want to be serious, I say drop the stupid "Spider-Man-less" Cinematic Universe idea and instead focus on doing an Animated Spider-Man Universe starting with Into the Spider-Verse which more people are positive about.
2018-10-03 03:47:20 The fact that mods are trying to remove and censor criticism of the movie only makes me hate it EVEN MORE. 
2018-10-03 04:28:57 So suicide squad pulled this stunt, now every movie gets to use it as an​ excuse. 
2018-10-03 05:28:13 Don't worry Tom Hardy. I thought this movie was hot garbage in spite of your own best efforts to do your job well. 

The first mistake was Sony's own hell-bent ambition to even bother considering this movie in the first place without Spiderman being *properly* integrated into it's story.

The very idea of Venom himself was because some guy basically coloured Spiderman black and then Marvel bought the idea from him. He was later written to basically be the exact polar opposite of what Spiderman was. Venom only exists *because* of Spiderman. The fact that Sony has been so hell-bent to desperately make something out of this while ignoring that is pretty irritating. 

I'm not interested in this movie, and I sincerely hope it bombs like crazy. Then in five years we get a *proper* Venom story finally from Marvel, using their universe and their Spiderman as it's origin. 
2018-10-03 05:46:46 Ugh, my girlfriend really wants to see this film and I've been telling her for months its going to be shit. I think she just wants to see Tom Hardy lol
2018-10-03 05:53:01 40 minutes isn't going to magically make the other 140 minutes of shit smell any better...
2018-10-03 06:11:32 This may be stupid but I really hope it flops hard because they did not make it R rated like it should be..
2018-10-03 06:18:57 well there goes my hopes for this movie not sucking
2018-10-03 07:00:41 RELEASE THE SNYDER CUT SONY
2018-10-03 08:00:12 This has the stink of another Fan Four Stick all over it. 
2018-10-03 08:41:34 I really hope this is good, but I'm losing faith. I mean, the star says his favorite scenes aren't even in the picture, and the director's defense of the PG13 rating is really weak. 
2018-10-03 08:42:38 they should scrap this movie, change a few bits and pieces, and turn it in to a movie of the video game _The Darkness_. And ask Mike Patton to reprise the voice of The Darkness.

Throw Henry Rollins in there too.
2018-10-03 08:53:00 All the excuses are a great indicator of it going to be a shhhhiiiiiiiit shhhhhhhhowwwwwwww.
2018-10-03 09:25:11 Either Hardy is genuinely upset or he's trying to salvage a following for the eventual director's cut which will have those deleted scenes. 

Either way, it's clear he knows this movie is hot garbage. 
2018-10-03 09:35:18 Hey can I post this tomorrow? I mean since you only waited 24 hours since the last guy did...
2018-10-03 09:38:14 This movie is gonna suck 
2018-10-03 09:38:32 I called it after the first sneak preview; this feels like Spawn (1997).
2018-10-02 22:51:50 This is the reason we have such animosity towards the studios! They want this dumb fuck time limit fixed to the movies and want to control the editing process so every movie fits a cookie cutter time frame of 90 minutes, or whatever. I know everyone hate BVS but I thought the 3 hour cut was a much better film. Also I really would have wanted to see the over 3 hour cut Joss Whedon had of Age Of Ultron. It's bloody silly. And these people who run the studios, are now facing the reckoning of the fans, we say don't overthink it, make the things we like, and make them well, don't be scared to change things, but bring in competent people to write and direct. But they don't do that, they want to make everything as difficult as possible. They don't want input from the real creatives and visionaries who'd make the right choices! For fuck's sake can we take a lead from Dead Pool you can make R rated Marvel movies, that will make plenty of money; and they can be dulled down for the cross over you know, it's not that hard. 30 or 40 minutes isn't that much different, we can sit in our seats for the extra time you know, that seats are quite comfortable, and if the movies great, extra applause. 

Apologies for the rant.
2018-10-03 00:15:37 You mean the mediocre 2 1/2 hr movie could have been a mediocre 3 hour movie? 
2018-10-03 01:19:10 Mods get paid to censor this sub. Nice. 
2018-10-03 03:58:16 He's Jared Letoing already. This isnt going to end well 
2018-10-03 12:25:11 Sounds like it's time to pass a bill preventing Sony from touching a super hero franchise ever again.
2018-10-03 00:02:09 What a shitpost what the fuck lol.
2018-10-03 00:51:31 He did Nemesis and thought Mad Max would be bad. Also his version of Bane?

Hardy isn't the best judge of quality.

Sometimes a longer cut is better. Like Lotr or anything Snyder did. But sometimes more won't make it better.
2018-10-02 22:48:02 It keeps getting worse. 
2018-10-02 22:55:37 mostly footage of Venom combo kills and sym-biote pseudoscience.
2018-10-02 23:31:16 Probably the good parts
2018-10-02 23:47:49 Great so we can expect the 'super awesome director's cut that finally makes the movie amazing' on bluray and digital streaming.
2018-10-03 00:13:34 Sounds like a job for Damage Control.
2018-10-03 00:15:52 Any chance of an unrated directors cut in the future?
2018-10-03 00:18:34 that is a big cut
2018-10-03 00:19:21 Welp, that sucks
2018-10-03 00:35:29 DAE hate the movie already???
2018-10-03 00:43:33 What are the studio dynamics that cause this? They had the budget and the star power. 

Are they just making movies like this for mass consumption in China and other large eastern populations?
2018-10-03 01:03:45 Someone call Jared Leto. I think there’s stories to be shared.
2018-10-03 01:06:59 How do you think this bodes? 
2018-10-03 01:14:37 It was 40 minutes of Venom with googley eyes and I’m as upset as Tom!!!
2018-10-03 01:21:02 darth vader should just show up at the end of every movie..
2018-10-03 01:21:28 Even more of a reason to not see it. 
2018-10-03 01:29:54 I feel like when a director sets out to make a movie with the rating sitting in the back of his mind, I think it’s a bad sign. If he had sort of said the rating was an after thought, I’d be a bit more excited. Then again though venom probably is fine being PG-13, carnage has some pretty disturbing solo comics (mindbomb comes to mind) but as cool as venom was R level violence never felt like his thing. 
2018-10-03 01:31:35 because money and PG-13 ruins movies
2018-10-03 01:32:47 I thought having like 30 minutes cut from the final was part of every movie making process, lol?
2018-10-03 01:33:23 got the feeling the film is still going to feel 40 minutes too long..
2018-10-03 01:39:47 Ouch. And here's where the hype for this one really starts to diminish. I had a bad feeling about this from the initial announcement.  Oh well. 
2018-10-03 01:42:54 How would an actor even know how many minutes were on the film before the final cut, unless he sat in the editing studio with the director and watched 40 minutes get snipped (not likely)?
2018-10-03 01:44:14 Might that even be below average?
2018-10-03 01:45:27 Must have been the good 40 minutes. 
2018-10-03 01:56:08 I'm sure the movie would have still been shit with the 40 minutes included.
2018-10-03 02:01:11 OH GOD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2018-10-03 02:02:13 Just look at the trailer. They should have cut all of THAT footage.
2018-10-03 02:15:20 Oh boy I can’t wait for this steaming pile of shit of a movie.

Don’t pictures you so funny.


But fuck you for screwing up venom. 
2018-10-03 02:21:56 The actual quote was "His favorite 40 mins of the film". Why the cut quote? I think it's important that we know the lead actor is saying the best stuff they shot was cut from the film. Super disconcerting dor anyone hoping it wasn't goint to be a tire fire of a movie...
2018-10-03 02:25:40 TOP 10 anime betrayals
2018-10-03 02:34:53 Disregard Venom; watch Upgrade instead.
2018-10-03 02:42:43 cant wait for the full version to come out later to purchase lol
2018-10-03 02:43:52 I hope this doesn’t turn into a Snydercut kinda thing.
2018-10-03 02:45:03 Yeah he's not a happy actor it seems. 

Why can't Sony just fuck off and let directors work?
2018-10-03 02:45:41 Is this tom hardys first fluke ? 
2018-10-03 02:46:38 It's weird... The movie looks like it's going to be incredibly entertaining but story wise it cannot be justified in it's existence without Spider-Man. So. Idk if I care. It's either gonna be fun to watch or it's going to be a dumpster fire.
2018-10-03 02:46:41 Well the director sounds like a robot twat. It’s as aggressive as it could be? Then why cut so much? It’s cause the bitches pushing buttons don’t know shit except how to fuck up franchises. Maybe these fuckers should’ve READ venom and seen what the fuck goes on with him. 
2018-10-03 02:49:06 Release the Venom Snyder Cut!!!!
2018-10-03 02:51:30 Movie Made by Sony Pictures.

Doomed by terrible decisions by the studio.

Yep, it adds up.
2018-10-03 02:53:05 And it were the best 40 mins of the movie 😩🤦🏻‍♂️
2018-10-03 02:56:00 But, what does "Cut 40 minutes from the final film" mean?  
A final edit was made, and then 40 more minutes were cut? Or they planed for a 2hr 40min movie and cut out random scenes to reach 2hrs?  
He says that there is no "R" rated super cut out there, so what does he actually mean by "40 minutes were cut"?
2018-10-03 02:59:45 that's some of the worst advertisement for a move that's days away from being released, I wonder what he was thinking when he said that 
2018-10-03 03:03:12 Like anyone is surprised about this. Was Tom Hardy expecting a 2.5 hr+ Venom movie?
2018-10-03 03:06:10 40 minutes cut from a 2-hour-20-minute film. So, THREE HOURS of a nasty guy biting people's heads off?! That's a bladder-bursting length for any movie.
2018-10-03 03:06:51 yay! extended edition blu ray!
2018-10-03 03:07:00 were they the good 40 minutes?
2018-10-03 03:07:51 I bet its the r Rated stuff
2018-10-03 03:11:03 This movie is going to suck. This post confirms it
2018-10-03 03:14:14 Can we talk about how the previous thread was taken down because Sony paid the mods to remove negative critisicm? Seems like a big issue...
2018-10-03 03:15:45  "transforms him into a monstrous supervillain."

What? Either this article is wrong in its understanding of supervillain, or this movie isn't about Venom. 
2018-10-03 03:34:28 The whole film should be cut.
2018-10-03 03:34:40 Uh-oh
2018-10-03 03:36:13 Like with almost every single movie ever made? 
2018-10-03 03:49:44 I fucking loathe the companies holding Marvel characters hostage. Deadpool, X-Men, Spider-Man (sorta)...almost as much as I hate Marcel for allowing it. 
2018-10-03 04:02:25 Oh.  Byyyyeeee
2018-10-03 04:31:25 Stopped caring once I found out it got a pg rating. 
2018-10-03 04:33:01 And the fallout begins. 
2018-10-03 04:40:39 Damn. Idk if thats a good or bad sign.
2018-10-03 04:40:50 "He's(venom) as aggressive as fans could possibly hope for, I think." 

If you just think it is and don't know. Then it isn't.
2018-10-03 04:44:15 So it begins...
2018-10-03 04:44:36 That was 40 minutes I really wanted to see, Rated R.
2018-10-03 04:48:08 Yeah... always knew Venom was gonna suck but when people come out before the movies is even out and makes excuses you know something will be Green Lantern levels of bad. 
2018-10-03 04:49:37 What are these guys doing to superheroes?

PG-13? Best scenes cut?

So LAME.

&#x200B;
2018-10-03 04:50:26 Warner Brothers own Sony? Or are they just outsourcing the editing? 🙃
2018-10-03 04:54:07 This is Sony right? Not surprised. Fuck Sony!
2018-10-03 04:54:34 Well I'm gonna be a weirdo here and reserve judgment until I see the movie.
2018-10-03 04:56:35 Imagine a real life plot twist where this movie actually turns out to be good
2018-10-03 04:57:23 This movie looked like trash from the beginning. But what else would you expect from a superhero movie by Sony post-2010
2018-10-03 04:59:31 they really trying to sell every movie twice with an extended cut
2018-10-03 05:00:31 Okay, but where are the early reviews here? I'm considering hosting a "shitty movie night" here, but it needs to actually be entertainingly bad for that to work out.
2018-10-03 05:08:21 They were of just Tom Hardy screwing around as Venom. He clarified it himself during the premiere of the movie.
2018-10-03 05:12:00 Aaannnnnnd now its gonna suck. Didn't take long.
2018-10-03 05:14:18 i want this movie to be good, but i know in my gut it will bomb
2018-10-03 07:09:11 Early reviews are not good 
2018-10-03 14:31:06 Tom Hardy does damage control.
2018-10-03 19:07:18 This movie is going to be so trash.  But I got a ticket for $1.50 so I still may go.
2018-10-03 19:12:35 Splicing this movie together with clips from 'Upgrade' should fix the issues.
2018-10-03 20:21:27 Tom is just preparing you for the disappointment when you realise this isn't going to be a step up from Mad Max fury road. It was better actually but those producers hate you and so they removed the 40 BEST minutes of the film and replaced them with some real stinkers.

I for one am glad I can see this film now and know that the greedy greedy producers stole away my 40 favorite minutes so they could have it for themselves because my best friend Tom told me. 
2018-10-03 21:27:22 It was probably all the content that would have made it 'R'...
2018-10-03 21:42:53 
So that's what the problem was. 


2018-10-03 21:46:35 Lol that's always the excuse when a film bombs with critics. The "real" masterpiece version was left on the cutting room floor. 
2018-10-03 23:01:39 I'm glad I was here to witness the demise of the mods, all courtesy of Venom.
2018-10-04 08:19:16 Sounds like we will get some nice extended tan cuts. Or maybe even a directors cut if it makes any money. 
2018-10-20 23:31:59 Yeah it did feel kind of boring with parts being cut here and there. 
2018-10-28 04:05:59 Is there anyway to watch the entire thing online? 
2018-10-02 21:46:15 Removal in 3... 2... 
2018-10-02 23:26:40 This is the third time I’ve seen this and probably the 9000th time this has been posted.
2018-10-03 08:02:43 And this is why Fox and Sony just needs to give all Marvel rights to Disney. 
2018-10-03 00:33:45 Actually, most movies end up *cutting hundreds of hours* of footage from the final version...
2018-10-03 07:06:44 All that CGI could have been used to feed starving kids in Africa
2018-10-03 07:57:42 Everyone I know that's worked with this guys says he's a huge cunt. Fuck his films. 
2018-10-03 10:52:43 I'm starting to think Hardy was ignorant on what type of 'Marvel' film he would be in. It would be hard to believe he didn't know he wasn't going to be starring in a MCU film before he signed on. Those Sony suits definitely managed to sweet talk him with a supposed good script or a lot of mulah.
2018-10-03 13:50:58 Who cares for 'Venom' when there will be 'A Star Is Born'?
2018-10-02 22:42:10 *but see what had happened was...*
2018-10-02 23:56:56 Still no RT score. How late will they post the splat 23% ??
2018-10-03 00:28:53 Probably a lot of that were the rated R bits, kind of a bummer they turned it into a PG-13 movies instead of going the Deadpool route. 

2018-10-03 00:43:20 Meh.  Anyone who saw the trailer already knew this was going to fucking suck. 
2018-10-03 00:45:08 ITT: "making excuses before it's even released!"

Also ITT: "I HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE BUT AS AN R/MOVIES POSTER AND RICK AND MARTY CONNOISSEUR I KNOW ITS GONNA BE AWFUL"
2018-10-03 02:22:11 Welp, I guess I'm waiting for the extended R version on DVD.
2018-10-03 03:42:10 Don't worry guys, the 5 hr "director's for reals this time cut" will be its saving grace
2018-10-03 03:50:12 So what? Every movie gets cuts, just look at Star Wars the last jedi, they totally fucked that movie through editing and post production.  Hopefully Venom is still amazing.
2018-10-03 03:51:08 Oh lord, here comes the army of idiots clamoring for "MUH UNCUT RELEASE" as if that will actually improve the film.
2018-10-03 06:16:08 I strongly urge people to actually watch the interview where he says what he says, because these tag lines don’t really fill good context into what he was talking about. He stresses the fun he had improvising a ton, not complaining that “there was so much cut from the movie”. 
2018-10-03 06:38:15 Why is an actor commenting on scenes that may or may not be in the movie? Isn’t that a job for the editor or director? Also how long of a movie did he expect them to release? 
2018-10-03 06:39:10 Its okay.  The actual version will get released on dvd as the uncut and unrated version. Ykno so they can make more money. 
2018-10-03 06:51:23 What are we some kind of Venom?
2018-10-03 07:22:24 Get ready for the $40 5k ultimate limited edition featuring 40 bonus minutes not seen in theaters 😱 
2018-10-03 08:11:39 I heard they left out a scene with full penetration and at least 40 extra seconds of dong 
2018-10-03 08:19:06 Don't most movies have a decent amount of footage that goes unused? This doesn't seem relevant. 
2018-10-03 09:40:21 Damn, I was excited to see this movie....Was actually going to leave the house and go to a theater and watch it.
2018-10-03 09:40:24 Guess we can expect those 40 mins on blue ray then...
2018-10-03 09:52:58 God I’m excited for this film.

It’s either gonna be a mediocre self aware film or a hot dumpster fire and either way I’m gonna be entertained. 
2018-10-03 10:12:13 Were those 40 minutes the development of why Venom hates Spider-Man so much?
2018-10-03 10:20:12 I honestly thought it was a joke/some old ass snl skit when they showed it months ago( was that leaked?). Hopefully it isn't another Suicide Squad level bad (god that movie was bad).
2018-10-03 10:52:18 Yeah I'm sure that would have saved this 2008 Catwoman film
2018-10-03 11:05:57 Hoo boy
2018-10-03 12:05:41 I loove how this becomes the new excuse when a film goes badly "Well we cut an hour of contrnt away"
"Yed but it was deemed by a board of peopley that these scenes were totally unnecessary
2018-10-03 12:14:54 lol its so weird how sony are fine handing off the reigns to marvel for spiderman to marvel no problem but completely micro manage their own stuff into the ground
2018-10-03 16:05:25 Should have gotten Insomniac to makes this movies 
2018-10-03 16:42:42 We talking about this again for like the 3rd/4th time this week eh?? Seems legit 
2018-10-03 17:13:25 27% on Rotten Tomatoes lmao
2018-10-03 18:36:33 Honestly the movie looked like shit from the first trailer. I have no hope for this movie now.

Edit: just saw the review thread. guess I was right. thanks for the downvotes tho ;)
2018-10-03 18:44:47 It was awful but it could have been longer.
2018-10-02 22:03:24 [deleted]
2018-10-02 22:58:34 Tom Hardy also needed to see Fury Road on the big screen before he realized it wasn't trash like he assumed during filming. So I'd take his opinions with a grain of salt
2018-10-02 22:48:00 This has shitty amazing spiderman 2 all over it.
2018-10-02 21:48:50 ITT: a bunch of people who are so busy being outraged they don't even realize that one of the mods themselves literally made this post.
2018-10-02 22:29:36 The Russians did this. 
2018-10-03 05:46:00 So how much money did mods make here in r/movies from sony?
2018-10-02 22:22:10 [deleted]
2018-10-02 23:21:40 Subreddit rules only apply when it's convenient.
2018-10-03 00:29:09 Good
2018-10-03 06:52:11 saving face before it bombs. wtf was he thinking taking this role anyways. hes tom hardy for god sakes
2018-10-03 07:05:52 I still wanna see the movie 
2018-10-03 07:05:59 A lot has been cut from the film. It's called editing 
2018-10-03 09:37:35 My wife would also like to have 40 unseen minutes with Tom Hardy.
2018-10-02 23:29:34 Hopefully they cut the other 230 minutes before release, and save us from this travesty.
2018-10-03 06:01:40 You can't complain when you sign up for a Disney/Marvel film. You are a sheep in a money making machine with no artistic integrity. Just shut your mouth and collect your check. 
2018-10-03 00:25:14 TIL Tom Hardy is 41 years old. Crack cocaine did a number on him. 
2018-10-02 23:47:58 Great so we can expect the 'super awesome director's cut that finally makes the movie amazing' on bluray and digital streaming.
2018-10-03 00:20:49 Guarantee too change it from R to pg13
2018-10-03 01:01:16 Venom is sounding like a dumpster fire. 
2018-10-03 01:02:05 That suggests this was a very poorly planned movie.
2018-10-03 01:08:56 Tom Hardy to world: "Must... distance... self... from... this... horseshit!"
2018-10-03 01:09:32 Gone. Like a turd... in the wind.
2018-10-03 01:43:30 This movie is gonna be DC bad.
2018-10-03 04:40:57 He said the best 40 min were cut 
2018-10-03 05:14:42 Well at least they gave us that small mercy.
2018-10-03 05:19:34 That’s probably a good thing 
2018-10-03 05:22:55 So it begins. 
2018-10-03 05:26:55 K
2018-10-03 05:29:23 Tom Hardy needs to quit speed. It's obvious in his interviews and appearance. 
2018-10-03 05:32:27 Can we just admit that this film is going to be a fucking pile of dogshit just like everything else Sony releases?
2018-10-03 05:33:05 It’s not rated R 😩
2018-10-03 05:35:11 Frankly I hope his experience is so bad he never does another superhero movie.  These movies are doing nothing now bit ruining the careers of people who used to actually be good actors.
2018-10-03 05:40:12 Oh so he's trying the Suicide Squad approach.
2018-10-03 05:43:21 For sell....Tom Hardy's Cut...40 minutes of never seen video ....

If this comment has been previously posted, great minds think alike. If not, I'm cool with that.
2018-10-03 05:44:16 Why can't movies be long anymore?
2018-10-03 05:44:37 We are going to have extra and deleted scenes popping up from time to time for years
2018-10-03 05:46:30 Wtf, here we go with the bullshit. 🙄 this doesn’t sound good at all. Ugh....I didn’t have high hopes for this movie and it sucks. I love Venom, he’s my favorite Villain/Anti-Hero
2018-10-03 05:53:21 Jesus Christ, how many times can this be posted?
2018-10-03 05:56:13 Guess what we’re gonna see on the Blueray!!
2018-10-03 05:59:06 Were they the parts that would have made it rated R? Because that’s the Venom movie I want to see. Also why haven’t we had a Carnage movie yet?
2018-10-03 06:00:33 When you think you look good in a scene n cant wait to see it on the big screen but find out they cut the scene
2018-10-03 06:04:36 Low hope continue to sink even lower 
2018-10-03 06:06:23 My bet is that they did this so they can release an Unrated Blu-ray cut, so more people will buy the Blu-ray. 
2018-10-03 06:13:01 Never a good sign.

This has "Sony ordering reshoots because they wanted the film to show whatever they wanted" all over it.
2018-10-03 06:13:30 Directors cut it is. I am more sure now that i will like the DC than i was that i might like the movie sogodagonfameh
2018-10-03 06:13:33 Thank God a mod left a stickied comment on this thread!
Least now we don't have to worry about it being removed.
2018-10-03 06:17:48 THIS AND THE MEG WILL HAVE PHENOMENAL DIRECTORS CUTS!!!!!!
2018-10-03 06:22:54 LOL So what? who wants 40 more minutes of venom? 
2018-10-03 06:23:11 typical.
2018-10-03 06:23:52 this movie looks terrible. as a rated R silt movie it would have been awesome, I have no doubts that the watered down shell we will get will be unwatchable 
2018-10-03 06:30:57 This just in, films are edited! More at 11.
2018-10-03 06:31:24 Sounds like a good start. Only 112 to go, boys!
2018-10-03 06:32:00 40 minutes were cut and it's still 2h 20m? It was supposed to be a three hour movie?
2018-10-03 06:32:07 So are mods in on protecting this movie? What a weird rule 
2018-10-03 06:32:32 #JoinTheResistance
#SaveTheWorld
#BoycottSonyVenom
2018-10-03 06:34:16 So I guess it’s his way of saying the movie will suck 
2018-10-03 06:37:30 This doesn't bode well for the movie.

Also isn't this one gonna be PG13? Might explain lots of what was cut.

Ugh it's gonna be a stinker isn't it.
2018-10-03 06:43:16 Judging by the tv spots, that movie's gonna be a steaming pile
2018-10-03 06:49:14 Looking forward to the director's cut, I guess?
2018-10-03 06:57:35 They should just add that 40 minutes as an after-the-credits extra. People love those. 
2018-10-03 07:02:00 shame he did this, this movie is gonna suck
2018-10-03 07:02:36 I think the 38% on rotten tomatoes is reflective on that 
2018-10-03 07:04:46 This is gonna suck lmao
2018-10-03 07:11:25 This was hyped as a R rated alternate to Spider-Man. I guess they jumped the gun a little early and edited out all the R rated and forced PG13 in hopes of getting Spider-Man vs Venom. I am sure Hardy is out after this. Shame. 
2018-10-03 07:15:29 DVD Pre-Orders skyrocketing now.
2018-10-03 07:21:58 Got my tickets yesterday! 
2018-10-03 07:24:25 So he's saying to make sure to buy the "Unrated" version when it comes to a blockbuster near you?
2018-10-03 07:31:57 Is this the new excuse when a movie doesn’t live up to the hype? Sounds a lot like Suicide Squad and the missing Joker scenes 
2018-10-03 07:35:45 Will be revealed later as ~~DLC~~ bonus DVD extras
2018-10-03 07:44:41 Wow, that is unbelievable. 
2018-10-03 07:59:44 This doesn’t sound good 😟
2018-10-03 08:00:19 Saving it for Venom 2 as a flashback maybe?
2018-10-03 08:04:33 Sounds like the movie sucked.

I had a feeling. This is why we should demand better.
2018-10-03 08:10:51 can't believe
2018-10-03 08:15:54 I will only settle for the bigger, longer, and uncut version of Venom. I demand satisfaction.
2018-10-03 08:29:30 Damn that's a lot of time... how long is the theatrical cut?
2018-10-03 08:29:50 The trailers look terrible
2018-10-03 08:34:38 40 minutes of film rolled away, like a turd, in the wind
2018-10-03 08:38:02 Fuck Sony.
2018-10-03 08:39:38 Wrong, do your research scrub, he said they probably have 7 hours of footage.
2018-10-03 08:43:49 If this is the case, then hopefully it wasnt good enough for the FINAL CUT, or maybe it was just outtakes and deleated scenes.
2018-10-03 08:46:23 No, he said HIS FAVORITE 40 MIN were cut.

Not only is that a huuuge cut, but it sounds like the best stuff.  That’s unfathomably insane.

Sony: “oh shit, this movie isn’t good, but it’s definitely not hot steaming garbage, what do we do? uhhhh cut all the best stuff, obviously”
2018-10-03 08:51:49 It's gonna flop. Hard. 
2018-10-03 08:55:36 It is oit of context watch the interview then you will understand it
2018-10-03 09:00:33 Is this released already? In Sweden it gets released on friday
2018-10-03 09:09:19 Just gonna wait for the extended version to be released than. If Hardy complains, I ain’t on board. That dude is phenomenal. 
2018-10-03 09:10:07 Well it’s Sony 
2018-10-03 09:10:47 Oh, this is going to be a disaster.
2018-10-03 09:19:28 were those the sexy vore bits
2018-10-03 09:24:30 Can someone please explain to me what the mods mean by a social media reaction?  Is there any back story I’m supposed to know about here?
2018-10-03 09:33:03 Should have cut out the whole movie.
2018-10-03 09:33:19 The ol "suicide squad" defense is never a good sign
2018-10-03 09:33:25 That’s good to know because I’m sure ‘Venom’ will be declared one of those studio-tampered lost masterpieces like ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’.


2018-10-03 09:34:17 Gotta get content for the "Venom: The anniversary extended version" from somewhere.
2018-10-03 10:01:37 Run Tom! Run away!
2018-10-03 10:15:50 I will then wait for the Director's cut
2018-10-03 13:30:35 Well. Would you rather have a 2h 20 minute shit movie or a 3 h shit movie?

If it is shitty at this length I'm sure 40 extra minutes are not going to save it. It's more likely that it is a shoddily made movie, where they need over 2 hours to tell the story but it's still so shitty that they can't put a lot of better stuff in because it will destroy their runtime.

It's not like the extended BVS changed my opinion of that movie.
2018-10-03 13:49:13 All of it should be cut
2018-10-03 14:31:32 Soooo wait for the extended release version instead of buying straight away?
2018-10-03 16:37:53 After reading reviews for this movie today, maybe that's a good thing? 
2018-10-03 16:57:41 Last time I read sm like this was for Suicide Squad and we all know how that ended.......worse movie of the decade....so will this be the same?

2018-10-03 06:24:29 Purging normal people in Hollywood because he won't stand with Jimmy Kimmel and the rest of the reatrds political correctness. Pretty easy to see. You simple minded people need  to wake the hell up.

Edit yes even you op bot.

2018-10-03 00:49:20 boycott this fucking trash
2018-10-03 01:07:34 Nobody needs a 3 hour Venom movie. 2h20m is probably already pushing it.
2018-10-03 01:11:14 well that's not good. darn it looks like they botched this, which is pretty disappointing.
2018-10-03 02:42:08 This guy will always be Bane to me.   No matter what movie he starts in and in what role. He is Bane. 

He is a great actor, but sealed his fate with Bane role.    

Same with a few other actors whom done the same.

Kulkin will always be Kevin from home alone 

Umm...

I don't know the rest.
2018-10-03 03:29:14 Still very excited for this!
2018-10-03 05:34:00 Why? just why shoot that much footage and just leave it on the editing room floor? What a waste. Unless it distracts from the story, causes plot holes or interrupts the pace, put it the it in there.
2018-10-03 05:35:23 Ah, the DC movie treatment, Sony has learned from the best.
2018-10-03 06:22:28 Why am I getting Suicide squad flash backs...
2018-10-03 07:12:51 I don't know how people are surprised that this is gonna turn out bad. Those Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies were hot garbage, I hope they sell off their Marvel rights and we see some decent interpritations of these characters. 
2018-10-03 07:37:05 "I feel like we don't compromise Venom in any **real** way. He's as aggressive as fans could possibly hope for, **I think**."

So much bullshit in two sentences.  
2018-10-03 07:37:33 Ah that’s ok, I’m sure it’s mediocre either way
2018-10-03 07:45:46 The way the stuff they've kept in the film looks, not sure an extra 40 minutes would do it any good. Even if the stuff is a bit better, you're taking what looks to be a shit 2:20 and turning it into a (mostly) shit 3 hours, which is just too much. If they kept it and removed the shittiest 40 minutes in the current cut, then maybe they'd have something, but idk. It still looks like shit.
2018-10-03 07:53:09 That's... how film editing works, no? 
2018-10-03 07:53:32 Yeah well they should cut the rest too.
2018-10-03 07:58:42 Tom Hardy says 40 of his favourite turds in the wind were cut from final film.
2018-10-03 08:27:03 Well It can’t be any worse than Suicide Squad, or the Netflix adaption of Death Note lol It’s probably not amazing, but hopefully it’s not shit either. 
2018-10-03 08:46:56 It looked like shit from the very start, so to hear the excuses coming in already is NO surprise.
2018-10-03 08:49:48 I knew this movie would suck from the second I realized there was no Spiderman at all. 
2018-10-03 09:06:20     Reminds me of that time when Leto’s Joker was hyped up and excuses followed prematurely.
    I say , if you get a world-class star for a comic book movie ,you should also get a director to match. Otherwise it will inevitably flop. I don’t think Fleischer is a bad director just not the right man for the job.
2018-10-03 09:42:05 Take into account the question in the interview was, “what was your favorite scene to film?” Taking Hardy’s answer of “40 minutes worth of scenes were cut” and saying that 40 minutes were cut from the movie aren’t exactly the same thing. Imagine how many scenes get re shot, extended scenes, and take into account how much would have to be adjusted in order to appease the rating. 

I would love to see an R rated version of the movie but I think the director already commented on there not being an uncut version of the film. 
2018-10-03 09:46:14 The movie has a run time of 2:20.  It's fine and I feel like they are purposefully misrepresenting what Tom said there.  Why are headlines so fucking bad in 2018?
2018-10-03 10:44:04 When actors come out and say stuff like this about their movies, ESPECIALLY hero movies, ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY DC hero movies, I get a knot in my stomach 
2018-10-03 18:20:52 So...Tom Hardy explains that Venom was going to be massively over-long until they cut it down to a more appropriate run time?
2018-10-03 02:40:03 Now I'm not watching it. Good job.
2018-10-07 09:01:12 The Venom movie was good and currently relatable to everyday San Francisco pertaining to public corruption and the illegal bugging that went public, not symbiotes IRL. They filmed a lot on my block in SF. People actually go through that shit in SF.

P.S. The MoviesMod is just a shitty person or bot!
2018-10-03 01:22:38 Well we still got a strong Eminem song out of it, so it's a win for me.  Can't be any worse than A Quiet Place.  God that movie was awful
2018-09-14 03:01:28 Ah so biting heads off with no blood followed by a quick cut away. 
2018-09-14 03:43:21 A PG-13 Venom should have perfectly straight teeth and a lovely smile.  
2018-09-14 00:50:20 Rob Schneider is Venom

Rated PG-13
2018-09-14 06:22:10 Alternate title: "Venom officially receives a 47% on Rotten Tomatoes" 
2018-09-14 00:10:25 #FUUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKK

^(But only said once) 
2018-09-14 00:10:21 Color me shocked. 
2018-09-14 01:02:41 RIP Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters 

2018-2018
2018-09-14 00:25:12 Now the younger kids can come in and watch this with their venom action figure! 
2018-09-14 00:22:33 How many turds did they have to edit out to get the PG-13?
2018-09-14 02:05:25 And there’s the nail in the coffin.  
2018-09-14 03:59:35 Wasn't the reason Logan succeeded because they had no limitations? 
2018-09-14 01:37:05 I don't hate movies being PG-13. But I hate editing movies made with R-rating in mind to fit PG-13. 
2018-09-14 00:30:11 Honestly I don't think the R rating would have saved the movie from the way it's shaping out in the trailers, but it certainly doesn't help to make it PG-13.
2018-09-14 00:14:58 Like a turd...
2018-09-14 04:17:33 The only reason this movie slightly intrigued me was because I heard it might be rated R and thus could offer something unique that we would not get from disney. Probably won't see this in theaters, the trailers looked kinda eh
2018-09-14 08:00:05 Making Venom without Spiderman is a risk. Making venom in the most creative way possible to help sustain the comic lore was another risk. Going for PG-13 rating is just dumb. Are they just trying to attract kids or something? Embrace the R, this movie isn't going to make a ton of money but at least try to give us the anti-hero we deserve unlike Suicide Squad or the first 2 wolverine movies.
2018-09-14 00:40:49 KNOCK KNOCK LET THE PG-13 IN
2018-09-14 00:43:21 They said R-Rated before post-production, this sounds like the studio interfered with the final cut in an attempt to broad the audience.
2018-09-14 04:03:28 I've been saying it since the first trailer but this is going to be 2018's Suicide Squad (except I don't think it'll even make as much money) 
2018-09-14 07:57:19 This movie is going to be Suicide Squad
2018-09-14 01:50:47 Sure limits what they can do with Carnage in the sequel.
2018-09-14 06:53:22 A PG-13 Venom movie in a post-Deadpool world is a brain-dead decision and a guaranteed flop. Is Sony *trying* to fail?
2018-09-14 02:02:14 Sony, just give Marvel the rights back.
2018-09-14 02:47:36 Into the trash it goes, but i guess i should've figured that out from the trailers alone. Extreme disappointment.
2018-09-14 04:22:44 Yep, and with that, I'm OUT.  Sony went the generic blockbuster route.  
I thought when Tom Hardy signed up we might be getting another adult comic movie, but I should've known Sony would fuck this up.
2018-09-14 00:10:00 Venommmmmmm
2018-09-14 04:20:00 Not gonna be any turds rolling in the wind then, and probably not a lot of biting or people eating either.  


Expect a lot of big-mouth-roaring to scare villains as well as just general punching.
2018-09-14 01:34:00 4chan spoilers are out and seem kind of legit. The major takeaways where that.

1. It has been censored because the leaker said they saw an r rated version.

2. The movie is very average.

3. It has a very cringe scene featuring Venom making Eddy dance in the street. I believe this because there is leaked behind the scenes footage of the scene being filmed. 
2018-09-14 06:48:37 This movie's going to be the second coming of Suicide Squad.
2018-09-14 00:15:05 There's literally no point in a PG-13 Venom. They could have gone the Deadpool route. Then again, it was always going to suck since Venom makes no sense without Spider-Man
2018-09-14 04:48:28 Why do I have a feeling that they cut good stuff out to push this rating
2018-09-14 02:11:44 F
2018-09-14 04:03:51 That’s the kiss of death.
2018-09-14 03:03:55 This movie looks like pure shit.
2018-09-14 02:48:28 Hard. Pass.
2018-09-14 06:48:51 1. Venom w/o Spiderman

2. PG-13

3. Turd jokes 

Sony gotta Sony I guess. 
2018-09-14 04:08:17 I can only hear "Rated PG-13" in the [condescending South Park trailer voice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-gxcMidl9k)
2018-09-14 02:48:59 Gonna suck ass
2018-09-14 07:13:58 An R-Rating was the ONE thing this movie had going for it. THE ONE FUCKING THING. "Sure it sucks that Venom can't be in the MCU, but hey at least we get to see him be super violent and crazy like he's supposed to be" we all said and Sony of course had to be Sony about it and pussied out to cash in on that sweet sweet teenage audience. I seriously hope this bombs so Sony really doesn't have any other choice but to give the film rights back to Marvel.
2018-09-14 03:26:22 Oof, good luck with that one bois
2018-09-14 07:54:22 I want David Cronenberg's Carnage. With Viggo Mortensen and a fucking NC-17 rating!
2018-09-14 06:26:24 I don’t get it? I thought Deadpool made it abundantly clear that being rated R doesn’t mean you’ll lose money. If it’s a good movie people will go see it regardless...not looking forward to this movie at all
2018-09-14 06:45:01 Watch [Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hTLGlgZ4Z8) instead, that movie was awesome.
2018-09-14 09:25:54 Friendly reminder:

Nobody go see this movie, even if you're morbidly curious.  Sony does not deserve anything other than a massive box office bomb for their egregious misuse of their Marvel properties (and ya know, every other terrible thing they've done)
2018-09-14 05:51:37 Same mistake Suicide Squad

&#x200B;

YOU CANT HAVE A MOVIE ABOUT VILLAINS AND HAVE IT BE PG-13!!!!
2018-09-14 07:51:09 Meh whatever.  It’s a movie about Venom where his origin isn’t as Spider-Man’s black suit.  Why not just have a movie about Jesus which doesn’t mention God.  
2018-09-14 00:27:41 That’s ok. I knew it was gonna blow ass anyways. Didn’t have plans to see it and this is just another reason not to. 

Gotta love how Sony fucks over fans with characters they don’t understand or give a shit about. 
2018-09-14 07:41:12 And for that reason I'm out.
2018-09-14 07:44:24 Pass
2018-09-14 06:29:26 Fuck this. All the trailers are dark and very violent. They're pitching this as a very different kind of marvel character movie but don't have the balls to follow through. Why? Why try?

Marvel proper understood this situation perfectly with The Punisher. Zero punches were pulled with how he was treated in DD S2 and his own show.

I genuinely want to know why Sony bothers. Is it some kind of legal thing? Like if they don't shart out some cinematic abortion every few years they lose the Spiderman rights? Does this hold true even after their deal with Marvel? 

Because if it doesn't? Just.. Stop.

And I'm not saying you can't do a good Venom flick without being R-rated. But all the pre-release material is hardcore edgy and makes it look like horrible violence/gore happens seconds after the trailer cuts to a new scene.


Edit: and apparently they want this to kick off a franchise and will be crossing over with Spiderman.

'That July, Fleischer and Hardy both expressed interest in a crossover with Spider-Man, and indicated that Sony was interested in the idea as well;[10] in August, the studio confirmed that it planned to crossover Spider-Man and Venom by saying they "are already in the same universe—so without giving too much away, we are looking forward to the two of them eventually facing off in the future".[90] The same month, Hardy revealed he is signed on for two more Venom films.[91]'

By definition this has to be part of the MCU, no matter what Feige says.
2018-09-14 04:49:51 Fuck everything. I was pumped for this movie but it'll probably be shit for sure now. How the fuck can Carnage be in a pg-13 movie??
2018-09-14 06:52:51 Thanks Sony. 

      - Marvel Studios
2018-09-14 02:12:10 This is gonna be so bad. 
2018-09-14 07:50:14 I remember Venom as a really dark and sinister character, and nothing about him was PG-13. I don't know if my memory is wrong, but this news has made me 100% less likely to see it in a cinema, I can definitely wait for a ~~torrent~~ legally acquired DVD copy
2018-09-14 07:06:59 Gayyyyyyy

2018-09-14 14:21:22 then what was the fucking point
2018-09-14 04:55:38 This is going to suck so horrendously bad. 
2018-09-14 08:06:50 lol this movie is gonna suck so bad
2018-09-14 08:07:35 Like a shit rolling in the wind
2018-09-14 06:49:56 This movie is like a turd in the wind
2018-09-14 07:36:25 I guess that explains the "turd" line 
2018-09-14 09:26:05 Sony-makes movie starring anti hero that murders criminals
"Our market is 8 year olds"
2018-09-14 10:26:42 *like a turd*


*^in ^the ^wind*
2018-09-14 11:46:05 Ironically this will probably hurt ticket sales 
2018-09-14 12:17:45 Wait, what? I thought the whole existence of the movie stemmed from the successes of the R-rated Deadpool and Logan?
2018-09-14 15:23:22 Lame. Deadpool and Logan should be the standard, not outliers. 
2018-09-14 17:22:18 The movie's written by the guy who wrote *Amazing Spider-man 2* and *The Dark Tower*, and produced by Avi Arad and Amy Pascal. 

It was always going to be shit, regardless of the rating. 
2018-09-14 18:35:39 Oh look! All my interest is flying away! Almost like a turd in the wind
2018-09-14 00:31:23 I know the movie being PG-13 isn't indicative to the overall quality, Live Free or Die Hard was a perfectly enjoyable movie despite the PG-13 rating; however, one can only wonder why they chose to cut the film so it got a PG-13 rating when everyone knows the best way to truly do a Venom film is to make an R-rated movie.

PG-13 means that a number of scenes are going to be completely neutered and will lack the impact it would have had if it was rated R.
2018-09-14 03:19:31 I'm. Boycotting this and telling all my friends too. Fuck Sony and fuck them for holding the spiderman property hostage. If this movie succeeds they will do a kraven the hunter movie without spiderman. I mean how? 
2018-09-14 06:09:19 Probably skipping this one in cinemas then unless reviews are glowing.
2018-09-14 06:16:39 lol
2018-09-14 06:37:55 Not gunna go see it now 
2018-09-14 06:40:42 Aaaaaand there goes my interest in the movie...
2018-09-14 06:40:55 #EDDIE BWOCK
2018-09-14 21:44:37 I hope his nemesis Carnival shows up. 
2018-09-14 06:44:41 Venom? More like Vegan
2018-09-14 07:39:40 Deadpool and Logan prove R rated hero flicks can be successful. One of the more violent marvel characters goes PG-13.

ok.
2018-09-14 01:05:41 Anyone know if it will be Rated 15 in the UK? I know ratings can be shifted worldwide like Truth or Dare did

2018-09-14 06:45:16 https://imgur.com/bnxSdNj.jpg
2018-09-14 06:49:34 I don't think people are as much upset that it's PG-13, more so that if the movie had been R, it would have probably had a lot more going for it.  Plus, the material would have likely had more breathing room if it had an R-rating, but I guess if it got PG13 that means they didn't really film anything too dark that would get an R.  The studio is likely worried with this movie too and they figured that bombing with PG13 would at least gain more money than if it had an R-rating bomb

Logan would have likely still done well if it had been PG13, but in my opinion the material was much better suited for the R it received, and obviously it had that extra breathing room to be awesome with
2018-09-14 07:37:36 I'll probably catch it on Netflix now, I was mainly excited cause of the R rating so I thought they would take the movie in a different direction. Looks like it'll be no different than the other superhero movies. It's sad cause Deadpool and Logan were so awesome and the R rating game them the opportunity to show a superhero movie in a different light.
2018-09-14 08:06:23 Man, it’s almost like Sony hasn’t learned a thing over the past decade ever since Spider-Man 3. It seems like every single time they interfere with a movie wether that be the editing, plot, or direction, it’s always a detriment to the film. I can’t see how this is going to end well. 

I’m sure in a best case scenario they’ll try to sell a directors R-Rated cut that makes minimal difference to the film’s overall quality, but we’ll see.
2018-09-14 09:43:23 so it's going to suck significantly then? I couldn't really think of a single reason why a comic about a psychopathic parasitic symbiote that eats people would be PG-13 instead of R.


2018-09-14 10:22:34 I bet this movie is going to be a turd in the wind.
2018-09-14 10:42:10 downvote me if needed, but i really dislike most marvel/dc movies, they are bland and unfunny most of the time. the only good ones are Deadpool and the dark knight triology (even batman is bad at times (bane comes to mind)) as they were darker and much more catered towards an older audience.

suicide squad, avangers, guardians, thor etc etc etc all suffers from being childish shitfests of boring action and bad fighting sequences.

deadpool succeeded because ryan reinolds dared make deadpool what it should be.
2018-09-14 14:20:27 I was thinking of seeing this, but a PG-13 Venom without Peter Parker doesn’t sound fun. 
2018-09-14 14:52:25 This is a failure to the movie, and the character.  


**Venom** is not PG-13.  
Venom will throw you off the top of a building simply because he doesn't think you're worthy.  


Venom will devour entire cities if left unchecked, he's driven people to the brink of suicide, he's even slaughtered his own kind.  


If Venom is being pushed to PG-13, we have no chance for a Carnage movie.  
At least, not a good one.
2018-09-14 18:39:38 Thanks Disney. 🖕
2018-09-14 19:59:39 As long as it's good I dont need the extra gore and language. Give me a plot that makes sense, and realistic characters and I will buy it. Give me forced love interests and a bullshit storyline that only moves forward because of the characters idiocy, and I will get up in the movie. Theater and shit in my seat.
2018-09-14 20:23:54 Oh look, people overreacting over the internet, what a surprise. The rating wouldnt have made much of a difference IMO, blood and gore would have made the film cooler, yes, but if the film was going to be mediocre from the start, it would have been the same either way. Also, Venom comics are violent but there's barely any gore in them, so I don't see the issue here, I just hope they make a good rappresentation of the character.
2018-09-14 02:23:23 Does that mean no sex scenes?
2018-09-14 06:21:23 [deleted]
2018-09-14 04:47:35 Fuck this shit. 
2018-09-14 06:27:13 Well I'm out
2018-09-14 06:28:57 WEAK
2018-09-14 06:29:01 Wasn't this relegated to PG-13 as soon as he uttered "turd in the wind"?
2018-09-14 06:29:58 Well there goes everything
2018-09-14 06:30:29 nope
2018-09-14 06:33:17 I have to admit this disappoints me. So, basically Venom is tamer than Deadpool and Logan. Uh, that doesn't feel right. I hope they don't pull a Spawn: The Movie (1996) where the movie was released theatrically PG-13, then boasted an R-Rated version on VHS, but all they did was add a dirty word. 
2018-09-14 06:35:26 Well, guess I'm skipping it.
2018-09-14 06:50:16 This rating doesn’t affect me, because I won’t be seeing this movie in any way.
2018-09-14 06:53:27 This movie will be the next “Spawn”...
2018-09-14 07:33:14 GAY
2018-09-14 07:40:39 I think that this really indicates it’s quality. The reason they wouldn’t follow Deadpool’s lead and make an R rated Marvel movie is if they’re really not confident in it. 

PG-13 opens the doors to audiences who don’t care about movie reviews, so they might be doing this in anticipation of a critical bomb. 


2018-09-14 08:04:58 People forget that this movie is from Sony and that the recent Spider-Man game came out. Fox has the track record of making good R rated hero-movies like Deadpool and Logan.
2018-09-14 09:37:14 Hope for a director's cut blu ray release with a R rating. Then be let down again.
2018-09-14 13:15:47 Like a fart, in the wind. 
2018-09-14 14:09:54 Yeah I wouldn’t take my 13 year old to see that. It looks way too dark and violent from the trailers.
2018-09-14 14:16:37 Venom officially loses my interest lol
2018-09-14 14:47:13 I'm kind of sad about it. I wasnt happy that Sony was attempting to launch a spiderverse without spiderman and that it wouldn't be in the mcu. But they promised a hard R horror film and I went "shit that might be awesome." Then apparently they felt the need to tone it done to a generic looking action movie. Why does anyone let Sony make movies? They make the worst decisions.
2018-09-14 15:27:59 From the trailer the plot looks bad and the scenes looked over the top. The horror element was the only thing that enticed me to this movie but now that they have removed it I really don't think there is a place for this movie. It's not a dark version of the superhero movie. What new stuff does it bring to the table?
2018-09-14 15:28:44 It should at LEAST be a 15, though an 18 would be best suited for it.
2018-09-14 16:33:57 It's like Sony is begging movie goers not to watch this turd movie.
2018-09-14 18:02:46 Hahaha now it's official, this movie will suck hot garbage out of a truckers asshole. I'm guessing ...23 on RT
2018-09-14 18:06:44 PG-13? No no wtf you idiots. Venom is not a PG-13 character and you’re missing your target audience. 
2018-09-14 18:47:59 I have a growing feeling this movie is not going to be very good, despite Tom Hardy.
2018-09-14 19:38:45 Half the superhero movies are watered down crap anyway so I'm not surprised. 
2018-09-14 19:53:26 So we're just going to ignore the reasons Logan and Deadpool were so successful, huh?
2018-09-15 19:12:30 Oh brother...and of course the obligatory “But we pushed PG-13 as hard as it can go”. Please, a PG-13 is not going to push jack shit as hard as it can go. It’s still a PG-13 at the end of the day and if the studio actually had confidence in this film I see no reason why they wouldn’t have gone with an R. The wild success of Deadpool/Logan anyone? So now I just assume the film is garbage and won’t be seeing it in theaters. They promised fans one thing and delivered another so no money for you guys.

2018-09-14 06:52:48 Can we talk about how Venom without Spiderman doesn't even make sense?
2018-09-14 07:48:19 Idc, just have a good script, no safety-net writing to appeal to everyone just for a quick money grab. Fucking tired of every super hero movie being exactly that, watch this one suck balls. 
2018-09-14 12:02:03 Sony are straight up retarded 
2018-09-14 01:15:57 This movie is dead on arrival. Quote me on this.
2018-09-14 01:21:41 I'm pretty sure that it will end up being true, but [filmratings.org](https://filmratings.org) says nothing about it being rated anything. Until it is posted there, it isn't confirmed. Not a lot of room for hope, but still.
2018-09-14 07:02:38 PLEASE. You ALL know EXACTLY what the FUCK is going down. They're gonna release this as PG-13 to get 13 year old asses in seats who wanna be all cool and say they saw Venom when they return to school on Monday AND ALSO make some IMAX exclusive bullshit cut with five additional minutes of useless crap AND THEN weeks or months later(depending on how Shit the film is and how antsy they want their money back) release the R-Rated "Extra Venomous Edition" on Blu-Ray just to make any dumb bastards double-dip into a SHIT movie! DON'T be a DUMB FUCK and play into Sony's game! IF it turns out to be shit, PASS on the film and send a message to MARVEL with YOUR hard-earned Dollars! You want better Spider-Man & Friends films? DON'T SUPPORT POTENTIAL ASS GARBAGE!
2018-09-14 06:10:12 PG-13=limit to how good it will be. That's all. 
2018-09-14 06:59:01 It's officially going to suck. 
2018-09-14 07:43:01 That movie is going to be GARBAGE. sadface
2018-09-14 00:37:24 What's next, a PG-13 Punisher? PG-13 Blade?
2018-09-14 04:09:53 PG-13, the bane of good filmmaking 
2018-09-14 00:11:27 [deleted]
2018-09-14 02:18:06 This is gonna suck, isn't it.
2018-09-14 02:27:25 Well that says enough.
2018-09-14 03:41:28 At this point, I'd be amazed if this somehow turned out to be a good movie.
2018-09-14 03:46:15 What does Venom actually say in those scenes? Like bird? Something about so many juicy parts to eat?

Speak ENGLISH, fuggin aliens amirite?
2018-09-14 03:46:46 Really? That was one thing I was kinda banking on (long shot I know)
2018-09-14 04:15:27 Feel like the movie Upgrade is going to be a better Venom movie then Venom
2018-09-14 04:18:47 Fuck
2018-09-14 05:06:36 Oh, so it’s going to be crap. Duly noted. 
2018-09-14 05:14:05 Motherfucker
2018-09-14 05:51:05 Don’t even bother asking why. We are obviously dealing with insane people. It’s along the same lines as releasing a very graphic horror movie, then selling to Disney and having them produce it under their discretion for max probability on return. At this point it’s all about the numbers, they don’t give a shit about entertaining the audience that Venom was intended for. 

And yes, before all you come at me with “but venom was in the cartoon!” Bullshit. Just step back and think, was this movie really intended for your children?
2018-09-14 06:00:32 This movie will definitely have a “unrated” DVD Version once it’s out on disc
2018-09-14 06:06:48 :(
2018-09-14 06:13:47 MMW: This will be this year's *Fan4stic*.
2018-09-14 06:14:01 This is gonna flop
2018-09-14 06:20:05 Booooooourns!!!!
2018-09-14 06:20:06 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_asNhzXq72w
2018-09-14 06:29:40 Well damn. I’m actually really disappointed by this. 
2018-09-14 06:35:48 So now, at BEST, it'll be mediocre. 
2018-09-14 06:37:24 The first trailer looked bad, but it looked like it might still be showing action but it could have been a more psychological. 

Still it didn't seem to be about a true villain nor about struggling against Venom who acts like a villain for most of the movie.  No they wanted to make him an anti-hero and the anti in that description was optional. 

A shame because Venom is a great villain but Sony's track record has only been luckwarm at best with the superhero movies.  Still, I guess at Sony paid attention to Deadpool and Logan? 
2018-09-14 06:40:02 BOOOO
2018-09-14 06:42:12 Ugh. What a fucking waste. 
2018-09-14 06:45:28 Sooooo...this was a shocker to people? 🤔🤔🤔
2018-09-14 06:52:42 IM DOWNVOTING THIS TO SHOOT
THE MESSENGER AHHHHH
2018-09-14 06:53:08 FISSION MAILED
2018-09-14 06:58:55 Fuck.
2018-09-14 07:00:37 It's venom. It's supposed to be horror-esque. How many good horror movies have you seen with a pg-13 rating? The only saving grace is that it might now have a chance to join the spiderman universe. 
2018-09-14 07:01:48 They still don't realize the age of their real fans.  People not familiar with venom probably won't go.
2018-09-14 07:03:09 F
2018-09-14 07:03:49 Lame.
2018-09-14 07:04:58 And it's doomed. It's spawn all over again
2018-09-14 07:08:52 Ah well, thatl teach me to hope
2018-09-14 07:12:58 That’s lame. 
2018-09-14 07:12:59 Booo urns!
2018-09-14 07:14:34 Will there be an unrated version?
2018-09-14 07:18:43 Annnnnnnnnd i aint seeing it. I'm sorry but you don't take a dark character like venom and make it PG-13. I smell another suicide squad!
2018-09-14 07:19:07 Literally unwatchable
2018-09-14 07:21:39 Fuckin booooooooo.
2018-09-14 07:27:08 I guess I’ll be pirating this one. 
2018-09-14 07:27:09 Booo
2018-09-14 07:32:04 Fucking cunts. 
2018-09-14 07:34:54 Yikes.
2018-09-14 07:36:41 Bummer.
2018-09-14 07:37:29 Rip my hype level for this movie 
2018-09-14 07:40:36 I thought the whole point of Sony making this was they were free to go down the Deadpool and Logan path, something Disney won't do. Then again, I haven't been following the production news.
2018-09-14 07:40:46 Sigh... look Sony if you’re just going to abuse it you might as well give it all back to Marvel. You’ve been trying to make a good Spider-Man movie for over 10 years and Marvel made it in one shot. Clearly you don’t know what your doing
2018-09-14 07:42:58 the CGI looks so abysmally bad. straight up looking like that 15 year old hulk movie. also looks like a similar cliche I ran into some unknown shit and I turned crazy plot?

great actor to pick. horrible everything. sorry but the cartoonish sillyness of the CGI kills it for me. and I was never a fan of the character but after the trailer I knew it was going to be at best mediocre. 

Sony pictures has no idea how to make good movies. Spiderman is the only modern MCU movie 
2018-09-14 07:43:35 🚮
2018-09-14 07:44:37 Oh sweet I wonder what the inevitable reboot-before-they-finally-give-up-and-let-Marvel-make-it will be rated
2018-09-14 07:44:48 Noooooooooooooooo, stahhhhppppp! R is the only way
2018-09-14 07:49:53 does this mean we are going to get more awkward "turd in the wind" lines from Venom?
2018-09-14 07:50:51 BOOOO!!!
2018-09-14 07:52:30 How do you give him those teeth and then go and make it PG-13. Why even give him teeth at all?
2018-09-14 07:53:34 We have a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, a turd in the punch bowl.
2018-09-14 07:54:15 I have a feeling the best thing to come out of this movie will be Eminem’s single.
2018-09-14 07:54:52 This movie looks like a worse version of Upgrade but with a better version of Tom Hardy. 
2018-09-14 07:57:45 This is starting to feel more and more like Spawn (1999). 
2018-09-14 07:59:16 Well that just sucks. Low expectations for this movies.
2018-09-14 08:00:39 Bbbbbbboooooooooooooooooooooooo-urns boooooo-urns
2018-09-14 08:01:46 I thought the whole point of making a Sony marvelverse was so it didn’t have to be Disney censored. 
2018-09-14 08:03:08 Weak as fuck
2018-09-14 08:06:47 Lol
2018-09-14 08:21:48 why arent they making all these type of movies woth an r rating like deadpool. im pretty sure the majority of the sales will come from adults who enjoy gore, swearing and the occasional boob
2018-09-14 08:21:59 ....PAn-CReASSSssss
2018-09-14 08:32:51 Want to downvote because of the news, but upvote so everyone can share my pain. So, I give you nothing.
2018-09-14 08:33:00 I am disappointed, but not really surprised. 
2018-09-14 08:33:37 Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2018-09-14 08:36:54 Soundtrack will be rated R 
2018-09-14 08:39:06 Hey look, it just went from "ehh i'll probably see it" to "meh i'll probably wait for reviews".
2018-09-14 08:39:09 Way to kill a movie for me. I was really looking forward to hopefully seeing Carnage in all his glory, but nope. 
2018-09-14 08:53:01 Goodbye theatre viewing, hello cable premiere.
2018-09-14 08:57:30 I knew this would be garbage
2018-09-14 09:01:35 Yeah, no 

Fuck that, that's a no for me, I'll watch it for free at 123movies
2018-09-14 09:10:41 Also doing reshoots to have venom do all the fortnite dances. 
2018-09-14 09:33:56 Absolutely not watching this movie. Fuckin looks like super trash the only thing that could save it is violence.

Don’t @ me.
2018-09-14 09:35:50 Well, that turd in the wind line sounds like something 13 year olds will love!
2018-09-14 09:44:08 This is so fucking dumb 
2018-09-14 09:51:16 LAME
2018-09-14 09:56:00 This movie is going to be a ~~turd~~ ~~shit~~ poopie, rolling in the wind.
2018-09-14 09:56:36 Well Sony, after 'Turd in the wind' I was getting leary about going to see Venom. Now with the shift in the editing to get your family blockbuster PG-13 you have just list my ticket. Shame to, that original trailer really looked interesting in how the movie couod explore Eddie Brock and the symbiote having a relationship similar to what Peter Parker and it had
2018-09-14 10:29:32 I figured this would happen once they announced Eminem would do the soundtrack. They’re tailoring this to a certain demographic they deem would bring in the most profits, aka the “*shouting racial slurs in online video games while also cussing out their parents*” demographic. It would have been sick to have an r rated venom movie, more freedom for the directors to make a proper venom movie.

Eh, whatever, it was going to be a 50-50 chance of this happening anyway.

Edit: not that an r rating would stop that demographic from seeing it (it wouldn’t), just it’ll be nerfed from what could’ve been.
2018-09-14 10:56:38 I could have sworn it was said that it would be R-rated? 

Well, I think I'm gonna have to give this a pass. 
2018-09-14 11:00:30 well that sucks. no need to watch then
2018-09-14 11:06:42 GG
2018-09-14 11:07:01 Boooooooo


2018-09-14 11:07:25 These fucking people.
2018-09-14 11:07:42 It’s going to be the last Jedi of venom movies 
2018-09-14 11:18:17 Didn't they say it was going to be R when the film was announced?
2018-09-14 11:26:45 no excuse for this

can't use " it wouldn't sell tickets if it were rated R" as an excuse anymore
2018-09-14 11:26:59 Fucking Tom Hardy. 
2018-09-14 11:30:50 Who did you make this for, Sony? Who is the target audience for this? Do you even know? Did you ever ask?

This isn't for anyone, is it?

SONY? Did you make this for yourself? Did you make a Fant 4 Stick? I think you soiled yourself in the process, Sony.

I mean more than we are used from you. 
2018-09-14 11:56:40 Lol rated R venom was the only thing getting me to the theater . Guess I'll wait on this one.
2018-09-14 11:58:05 Looks like I just saved 15 bucks
2018-09-14 11:58:25 Well now I'm far less enthusiastic about seeing this movie... 
2018-09-14 11:58:33 So it's gonna be shit then huh? Shoulda been r rated like wolverine and deadpool. What's this pg 13 shit.. what kids under 13 even know who venom is?
2018-09-14 12:02:16 with a mouth like his you just want to see him tear some people apart. missed opportunity
2018-09-14 12:46:14 Think positive, the Dark Knight also had a pg-13 rating and was dark. 
2018-09-14 13:18:06 2nd time that the character Venom will die in the movie business.  
  
When will one of the most beloved characters actually get what it needs to thrive? The new Spiderman franchise needs to put Venom in a better light, but with this movie it seems impossbile.
2018-09-14 13:48:17 How do they expect to pull off a good venom movie with a pg-13 rating?
2018-09-14 14:05:27 I'm not surprised.  Let's be honest, Sony isn't interesting in pushing boundaries or doing anything new.  I'll rent it.  
2018-09-14 14:11:08 Well, we've discovered another issue men 20-39 care passionately about. 
2018-09-14 14:12:54 given all the stuff in the trailer just seems like this movie could have a movie adaptation of the game Prototype rather than Venom seems like the VENOM stuff was shoe horned in.
2018-09-14 14:14:40 Well, I'm out.
2018-09-14 14:16:32 This is very disappointing news. I hope to stand corrected, but I suspect the only chance this film had of being solid just went down the drain. 
2018-09-14 14:20:20 hahahahahahahha

*skip*
2018-09-14 14:51:18 Oh dear.
2018-09-14 15:24:35 I'll stick with Upgrade then. 
2018-09-14 15:30:08 just watch Upgrade instead. hell the guy even looks like Tom Hardy
2018-09-14 15:56:15 Fucking it up.....
2018-09-14 15:56:27 Damn it Sony 
2018-09-14 16:12:37 This is upsetting. I had hoped they would lean into the violence and body horror that comes with merging with a murderous alien goop to sell a story of venom without Spider-Man. Maybe they still will, but I don't know.
2018-09-14 16:48:00 It’s official now, turds in the wind are safe for teenagers.
2018-09-14 16:57:50 I have absolutely no interest in this movie. Trailers are terrible. Tom Hardy is great but not paying to see it in a theater. I can wait.
2018-09-14 17:04:53 Hi,  we're Sony! We have:

-Ruined Spiderman
-Added paid online
- Bought rights to spiderman so only we can make a shitty movie
- Just basically ruin everything
2018-09-14 17:08:04 Pass 
2018-09-14 17:20:45 Whats the concern here? It won't be violent enough? There are plenty of violent PG-13 movies. All this really means is no nudity, and only one F-Bomb. Neither of those are necessary for this character. 
2018-09-14 17:22:19 lame
2018-09-14 17:36:55 For the love of God just give Venom back to marvel. He's probably spidermans most iconic villain, and they keep messing him up. Imagine if marvel had him for one of the spidy sequels, I don't doubt it'd be amazing. 
2018-09-14 17:59:15 Boo. BOOO. This kind of needed the R. Venom is very much an anti-hero, one who gets just as violent, sometimes more so, than Deadpool. He literally eats people. Nerfing that may not work well, and Deadpool has proven that there's a market for R rated superhero movies. 
2018-09-14 17:59:20 So they can release venom unrated special edition for $40
2018-09-14 18:14:44 ##Damnit. 

The trailer looked awesome, too. 
2018-09-14 18:18:24 MPAA: Go harder next time, pussies
2018-09-14 18:28:56 Oof
2018-09-14 18:30:29 Venom is my favourite anti-hero.

This is just another franchise I love being shit all over because Sony owns the IP. The Dark Tower was bad enough, now they're fucking Venom too. What a horrible studio.
2018-09-14 18:38:55 meh, just means I'll watch it on tv instead at the theater.
2018-09-14 18:56:16 I'm okay with this Rating if Venom will show up in the MCU with Tom Holland's Spiderman. But if we lost the R rating and no chance for MCU showdown then this sucks.
2018-09-14 18:59:28 Welp, I guess this is gonna be a 65% and be in the premium cable rotation supplanting Justice League, Atomic Blonde, or one of those 'true story' shitty horror movies they play incessantly.
2018-09-14 19:24:12 Well that's the final nail in the coffin. RIP.
2018-09-14 19:26:33 Out of all the movies that I really REALLY want to be good but they won't be, this is one of them.
2018-09-14 19:36:25 Tom Rothman strikes again
2018-09-14 19:38:24 I hope the DVD is unrated and bloody as fuck!!
2018-09-14 19:58:04 Booooooooooooooo

&#x200B;

Sony you fucking blew it. 
2018-09-14 19:58:11 Already ruined.
2018-09-14 20:19:18 Water is wet 
2018-09-14 20:34:40 Bummer.
2018-09-14 20:35:29 If this scares you just try and remember Dark Knight was also rated pg-13.
2018-09-14 21:31:41 Lol fuck that what a buzzkill
2018-09-14 21:38:45 [deleted]
2018-09-14 21:41:09 FUCK YOU!!!

R was the only thing this movie could have possibly brought to get my interest.


2018-09-14 23:45:33 Welp there goes my hopes for a good Venom movie. I guess the old one is the closest I will get.
2018-09-15 01:38:14 Has Deadpool taught the studios nothing?
2018-09-15 02:03:36 Like a turd in the wind.
2018-09-15 11:24:39 >Sony once again proves it has no balls or spine, or faith in the content they produce, shocking absolutely nobody.

Would have been a better headline.
2018-09-15 13:24:12 I mean the movie looked pretty bad, but giving this film a PG 13 is a death sentence...
2018-09-15 16:16:19 I kind of already expected this was going to be the case, Sony is trying to copy the success of the MCU and it's pretty much what most of Hollywood does, force their movies to be PG-13 believing that this will get more people in the cinema seats.
2018-09-14 01:35:40 Rated R Version: "You'll be rolling around, like shit in the wind." 



Pg13 Version: "You'll be rolling around, like a turd in the wind." 




I cannot wait for this movie to come out. I think it'll incorporate the worst(imo best) parts of Spiderman 3 & Garfield Spiderman 2 and roll it all together into a single piece of shit, that will roll around, in the wind. 
2018-09-14 00:47:53 [lame](https://media.giphy.com/media/iN5qfn8S2qVgI/giphy.gif)
2018-09-14 02:52:40 Great. Another comic book movie ruined. Vemon is supposed to be over the top violent and not for kids. Guess ill have to miss out on another comic book film.
2018-09-14 03:04:24 BAHAHAHAHAHA.                                                         

So as bad a Fantastic 4 or worse since they have everything they need for a great flm but just blew it.
2018-09-14 03:18:24 👎
2018-09-14 04:56:56 Who the fuck actually thought this would be R? It's fucking Sony. They are doing what they can to milk a franchise after they failed to milk the bigger franchise it came from. 
2018-09-14 05:45:54 Oh, looks like I now won't see this movie.

&#x200B;

It's hilarious to me too considering Reuben Fleischer himself said that it would be weird to not have the movie be rated-R. Sony done fucked up once again.

&#x200B;

 "That's the plan," Fleischer said. "It is not the plan, that's the movie. Our movie wants to honor the comics as close as we can tonally. In the comics, he bites people's heads off and eats brains. It would be weird to make a movie with Venom if he wasn't doing that. We tried to honor it as closely as possible. This is definitely a darker, more violent, more vicious Marvel character than I think anyone's ever seen before."

2018-09-14 06:06:28 Imagine it’s the best “Spider-Man” Movie (if it counts?) Made yet
2018-09-14 06:18:31 No R? Thanks Trump.
2018-09-14 06:50:28 Yep. No chance a comic book movie could succeed with an R rating. None at all...
2018-09-14 06:59:21 This movie is now "rolling down the street, like a turd in the wind"
2018-09-14 07:10:48 Laaaaaaaaaame
2018-09-14 07:19:14 Aaaaand they've killed the movie.
2018-09-14 07:25:00 I mean I'm not super optimistic about the movie's quality but y'all are forgetting that the Dark Knight is PG-13
2018-09-14 07:36:59 And now it officially sucks.
2018-09-14 07:42:47 PG-13 Venom sounds stupid. Low expectations. 
2018-09-14 07:57:05 Well, there goes that franchise before it even gets started...
2018-09-14 01:25:13 "Venom, officially crap"
2018-09-14 01:25:31 That’s a real turd in the wind.
2018-09-14 01:52:31 Another nail in the coffin
2018-09-14 01:54:01 And Sony just proved they have no balls.
2018-09-14 01:57:16 Boooooooo
2018-09-14 02:12:08 This means it sucks, the studio knows it sucks and they're trying to salvage it by packing the theater with little kids on opening weekend  Tom Hardy needs to get his head out of his ass and listen to his agent.  
2018-09-14 02:41:48 Yikes. Going to be a a no from me. 
2018-09-14 02:52:17 what a wasted opportunity
2018-09-14 02:52:39 Nope.
2018-09-14 04:23:56 I hope this movie bombs and Sony let's Marvel handle the rest of the Spider-Man characters from now on.
2018-09-14 04:44:59 [Womp womp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EraHajW03qU)
2018-09-14 05:25:18 Nope. I’m out. 
2018-09-14 05:25:23 Aaaaand I’m not interested 
2018-09-14 05:33:13 hahahaha iys gunna suuuuck.
2018-09-14 05:54:53 This deserves one of those Hitler rant videos
2018-09-14 06:05:44 God damnit...
2018-09-14 06:06:27 Fuck this movie is going to be terrible. 
2018-09-14 06:26:53 And there goes my last bit of hope it wouldn't suck.
2018-09-14 06:48:01 And I no longer care about this movie.  
2018-09-14 06:53:06 So instead of a bad film with a R rating it will be a bad film with a PG-13 rating.
2018-09-14 06:55:21 Gay!
2018-09-14 06:57:18 "Alright, seems like we got some good interest among the fans for our new edgy Venom movi-*Aaaaand it's gone!*"

I joke but seriously, like half the people that were thinking about seeing this just decided not to see it.
2018-09-14 07:48:48 Why are they making a movie about a Spider-Man villain when they're not legally allowed to use Spider-Man? And don't say money because this shit isn't going to sell.
2018-09-14 11:19:35 Well that's beeping horrible.
2018-09-14 19:20:14 It's gonna suck ass and lacks Spider-man.

&#x200B;

I mean... In the trailers, it seems like Eddie Brock is a good guy, because people like Venom. But Venom was Spider-Mans suit to begin with (Secret Wars) and then... I can't even. It's gonna suck.
2018-09-14 01:06:03 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2018-09-14 01:27:04 WOMP WOMP
2018-09-14 03:14:47 Like a turd in the wind.
2018-09-14 05:24:06 Personally I never saw the absolute NEED for an R rating. Could it have benefited from one? Sure. However I don't think this character is as ultra violent and adult oriented as some people want to think he is 
2018-09-14 06:46:53 THE DARK KNIGHT WAS RATED PG-13!!!

&#x200B;

Relax people!!! This doesnt mean it will be a kiddie movie!

&#x200B;

All you people complaining about a Venom story being PG-13 need to realize that every version of Venom youve ever seen in the comics/cartoons has been PG-13, 
2018-09-14 02:51:24 I looked at the AMC page which is cited as the source and there's no mention of the rating there? In fact it was listed as "NR" (which I guess stands for "Not Rated") just a while ago? Not that I expect an R rating, but it seems  all these outlets are kinda jumping the turd... I mean gun?
2018-09-14 03:26:08 Oh well. 
2018-09-14 03:39:05 I mean they're banking a lot on this totally understand the rating. 
2018-09-14 03:50:15 Colour me surprised.
2018-09-14 04:23:03 rip
2018-09-14 04:26:26 Meanwhile, *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* gets a PG rating
2018-09-14 04:29:58 I can see why. Sony wants that sweet sweet cross over moneys with disney.
2018-09-14 04:33:17 Guess Tom Hardy's dick isn't as big as Ryan Reynolds, but then again I doubt even he could've saved this movie unless he shows up as deadpool and fucks flash tompson's wife, but whom I mean spiderman, by whom I mean Toby Maguire 
2018-09-14 04:33:19 Confirmed R rating for the DVD release then? I feel like it would be. 
2018-09-14 04:33:59 It's time to let out your anti R rated movie........

I will still probably go see the movie. But I will go in expecting nothing. Lol
2018-09-14 04:36:59 Wack.
2018-09-14 04:43:19 But why?
2018-09-14 04:43:55 Weak.
2018-09-14 04:44:45 We should all be hoping this does well. If it doesn’t, Sony will be ripping Spider-Man shared rights right back from Marvel.
2018-09-14 04:51:33 BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2018-09-14 04:57:30 I really wanna know who will be starring SPiderman in venom.
2018-09-14 05:01:30 [deleted]
2018-09-14 05:04:27 Lmfao, they never fucking learn.
2018-09-14 05:05:12 Weird the website as of 8:04p.m has it's not rated  
2018-09-14 05:07:59 Whomp whomp whomp
2018-09-14 05:08:26 don't think I'm watching this anymore
2018-09-14 05:08:44 And just like that you know it’s going to suck
2018-09-14 05:09:22 Aww man....:(
2018-09-14 05:13:00 After the Spider-Man game I’m actually down for that Silver Sable movie 🤷🏻‍♂️
2018-09-14 05:13:37 Maybe they'll go the "Live Free or Die Hard" route and release an R rated version on DVD
2018-09-14 05:14:21 Jesus that's lame
2018-09-14 05:15:40 Wasn't this a gamble to try and possible be able to insert this Venom with the current marval universe? Hard to do that with an R-rated film for a PG-13 franchise.
2018-09-14 05:19:51 RIP
2018-09-14 05:22:06 Then why the FUCK HYPE IT SOOO MUCH WHEN YOU STARTED IT
2018-09-14 05:22:34 Strike 22
2018-09-14 05:23:15 lol
2018-09-14 05:30:15 Going to wait for the reviews now before deciding whether to see it in theaters or renting.
2018-09-14 05:31:26 FRICK AND CRAP
2018-09-14 05:31:44 WHYY
2018-09-14 05:35:47 oh sony

when are you going to fire your entire film section for crying out loud.
2018-09-14 05:37:13 Booooo
2018-09-14 05:38:04 Fuck, I knew it before it was announced.

Goddamn it.
2018-09-14 05:39:35 He better cross-over with spider-man at some point to earn this. 
2018-09-14 05:39:39 Well that kind of ruins everything. I really don’t think this will be good. I would love to be proven wrong. 
2018-09-14 05:41:33 Man, this movie is gonna be "like a turd, in the wind"
2018-09-14 05:41:43 classic sony 
2018-09-14 05:43:50 Sounds like this movie is going to be a turd. In the wind. 
2018-09-14 05:44:12 Guess we aren't gonna get to see him ate a pancreas. 
2018-09-14 05:45:56 Well there's the last nail in the coffin.  Sony, you dumbasses.
2018-09-14 05:45:58 Sony taking a page right out of DC's playbook with this shit. Venom has many more issues other than being Rated PG-13.
2018-09-14 05:46:16 This movie is already a turd in the wind   


Sony is just doing this so they can hold on to the license (which is ok giving that they just released a cool PS4 game)
2018-09-14 05:46:40 When Sony does this shit, does it come from Japan? Or is it strictly Hollywood executives? 
2018-09-14 05:49:23 God fucking dammit
2018-09-14 05:49:27 BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2018-09-14 05:50:40 Oh FFS...
2018-09-14 05:51:32 Turd in the wind. Stupid decision
2018-09-14 05:51:50 I was behind this until this point.
2018-09-14 05:52:09 The fact they were not decisive almost guaranteed a pg13 rating. They would have sold more r rated tixs just off curiosity 
2018-09-14 05:53:11 Will Spiderman even be mentioned in the movie? Just makes it unwatchable without a Venom/Spiderman scene in it 
2018-09-14 05:53:19 Yup, not watching it

2018-09-14 05:53:33 WEAK
2018-09-14 05:53:45 So it's a turkey and they want to milk it for all that they can to try to recoup production costs. Got it 
2018-09-14 05:54:40 Goddamn this movie looks awful. I cant wait. 
2018-09-14 05:55:37 Fuck everything about this!
2018-09-14 05:55:54 Do you think it will be tied into the movie "Life" in any way?
2018-09-14 05:59:54 Booooo
2018-09-14 06:04:12 I remember the good old days when I'd go to the theatre at least once a week. I still check what's showing every week, but it's really only about once every two months that's there's something playing that I know I won't feel sick to my stomach for handing my money over to see as I walk out. Thought this might have been one. Guess not. I wonder what's opening in November... 
2018-09-14 06:05:40 Boo
2018-09-14 06:06:08 Well fuck you too Sony
2018-09-14 06:06:13 Yikes
2018-09-14 06:06:47      "Venom"

"See the movie"
2018-09-14 06:09:00 FUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKKK
2018-09-14 06:09:46 I rather watch that new Halloween movie
2018-09-14 06:10:21 Can expectations for this movie get any lower?
2018-09-14 06:11:30 Laaaame if you gona make a venom movie without spidey and the mcu go balls deep and make it R
2018-09-14 06:12:42 If you haven't seen it Upgrade is basically the movie Venom's trailers sold but Rated R and with American Tom Hardy 
2018-09-14 06:14:42 Ugh....
2018-09-14 06:16:06 Mister FAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCONNNNNN
2018-09-14 06:16:19 *Remember when they said this film was going to be R-Rated?*

*Good times, good times...*
2018-09-14 06:17:24 Candy-asses...i hate Hollywood
2018-09-14 06:17:35 Welp. 
2018-09-14 06:17:44 R.i.p.
2018-09-14 06:18:29 The greatest movie of all time! 
2018-09-14 06:19:05 lol it's going to feature the song Eminem made for the movie, only heavily edited.

&#x200B;

This movie was a dumpster fire the moment it was conceived
2018-09-14 06:19:15 Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
2018-09-14 06:20:01 Damn. This is so disappointing to me. I had really high hopes and just sorta expected the R release. Hopefully in 5 yrs we’ll get the reboot to R-rated. I’d eventually love a bloody disgusting Carnage.
2018-09-14 06:20:16 Boooooo. lost all interest that quickly.
2018-09-14 06:21:29  Boo
2018-09-14 06:22:08 Is this the movie that finally bankrupts Sony? 
2018-09-14 06:22:14 That’s so stupid man 
2018-09-14 06:22:24 What bullshit It would have been way more amazing if Sony given  it an R
Umm I'm pretty sure the movie will flop bet you 1 MiLL if this movie at least gets a 8.9 or rotten tomatoes 70%
2018-09-14 06:23:29 Who are they making this for??
2018-09-14 06:23:42 Cool 
2018-09-14 06:23:55 Looks like they learned nothing from Logan and Deadpool
2018-09-14 06:28:04 Booooo
2018-09-14 06:28:05 They have learned nothing from deadpool
2018-09-14 06:32:24 The symbiote's voice sounds like jigsaw with a breathing tube. 
2018-09-14 06:32:40 Hard pass on this movie. What the hell are they thinking?
2018-09-14 06:33:07 Ugh...should’ve been rated R.

I love Venom. He’s my favorite villain(or anti-hero). But I’m not feeling good about this moving. I feel like I’m being set up for disappointment. Hope I’m wrong though.
2018-09-14 06:33:37 Makes sense if they ever want to expand the Sony / Marvel Spiderman sharing arrangement to include Venom in a Spiderman film or the MCU.  

An R rating would limit the movie going audience to 17+ unless there is a parent... not good if you also want to push merch (toys) with the movie. 

Yes, Venom needs an R, but this is what were getting.
2018-09-14 06:34:39 I actually still wanna see this movie anyway. Just because I love Tom Hardy and I personally think it looks decent. 
2018-09-14 06:36:06 Yikes
2018-09-14 06:36:16 Booooooo.
2018-09-14 06:36:58 WHAT?!?! 
2018-09-14 06:37:12 Boo.
2018-09-14 06:37:41 Now, I still think this could work. For one, Venom isn't like Deadpool exactly. He's darkly humorous, yes, but not to that extent. And the comics themselves normally shy away from actually showing people getting their heads bitten off.
2018-09-14 06:39:09 Fucking bullshit man. I was so excited for this to be rated R fuck Sony they wanna start a marvel universe so bad smh
2018-09-14 06:40:30 are we really that surprised? Sony never released red band trailer of course they were going to fuck this up
2018-09-14 06:40:57 STUPIDDDDDD. 
2018-09-14 06:41:20 Wasnt this supposed to be R18? 
Guess I am not watching this at the cinemas now.
2018-09-14 06:41:28 lame af
2018-09-14 06:41:48 uh ha...what
2018-09-14 06:41:51 It was absolutely daffy to think it'd be otherwise 
2018-09-14 06:42:58 Atleast it's for venom and they didn't waste carnage 
2018-09-14 06:42:59 So it won't be gritty and raw like Logan and it wont have the dirty humor and violence of Deadpool. 

Probably more in line with a typical SpiderMan film. 
2018-09-14 06:43:14 Has anybody pointed out that Venom sounds exactly like Hexxus, portrayed by Tim Curry, from the 1992 animated classic "FernGully: The Last Rainforest"?
2018-09-14 06:44:03 I see no problems with a PG-13 rating.  Too bad the actual movie looks like trash, though.
2018-09-14 06:44:25 Goddamn it
2018-09-14 06:44:43 So I guess that means a good movie featuring Carnage is never going to happen. Shame.
2018-09-14 06:45:24 Didnt the director say this was supposed to be really violent?
2018-09-14 06:45:27 These movies are all so boring, vanilla, and predictable. Waste of time and money.
2018-09-14 06:47:02 I never expected it to be R. Neither Sony nor Marvel would ever let it be that way. 
2018-09-14 06:47:10 I wish they would have gotten it rated R. 
2018-09-14 06:47:44 So a movie about a cannibalistic violent murdering alien symbiote..........is essentially a teen movie. 

Good fucking job guys. Can’t wait to hear what other bullshit reason you come up with on why it tanked. 
2018-09-14 06:48:03 I've been immediately not interested in the movie since it didn't have anything to do with spiderman to begin with. This is just Sony holding on to the rights because they have no choice but to make *something* with the rights in order to keep them or whatever. 
2018-09-14 06:48:03 Hopefully (I highly doubt it though) They have an "R" Rating for a DVD release 
2018-09-14 06:48:06 I want the r rating, i want the horror venom
2018-09-14 06:48:54 Lol Rekt!
2018-09-14 06:49:03 HAHAHAH "horror superhero movie" they said...
2018-09-14 06:49:06 Hahaha cowards
2018-09-14 06:49:31 Well, that listed long. Lame. 
2018-09-14 06:50:31 Ouch...Of all villains to get their own movie, only pg-13? ... What a waste...
2018-09-14 06:51:15 Noooooooooooooo
2018-09-14 06:51:22 There it is.
2018-09-14 06:51:41 And suddenly I’m not as interested in seeing the movie as I was 5 minutes ago. 
2018-09-14 06:51:52 And I have officially lost interest. 
2018-09-14 06:52:00 Annnnnnd now I won't bother watching it.
2018-09-14 06:52:59 I've fully embraced my inner antihero at this point
2018-09-14 06:53:05 Will now just wait till redbox

2018-09-14 06:53:40 NSFW [Now there's your hard "R" right there](https://i.imgur.com/Cqe9xI3.jpg)
2018-09-14 06:53:45 As if there was literally any other outcome here. He’s aSpider-Man character. You gotta be able to sell the movie to kids. 
2018-09-14 06:53:54 boo
2018-09-14 06:54:10 Boo!
2018-09-14 06:54:34 This films already fucked.... Sony just give up.
2018-09-14 06:55:22 Ruined in every way and form.

&#x200B;

Definetely not supporting this.
2018-09-14 06:55:44 Even though I knew in my heart this would be the case, I didn’t think I could be less excited for this movie.
2018-09-14 06:55:49 Rip 
2018-09-14 06:56:27 I knew this movie was going to be bad from the first trailer I seen this just confirms it....
2018-09-14 06:56:31 This film is the shit show to end all shit shows. RIP.
2018-09-14 06:56:36 Rated G,PG,A.. R, previews looked horrible either way. How many years did it take to get a good Deadpool? I guess i can wait again. 
2018-09-14 06:56:48 Boooooooooooooooooooooooo.
2018-09-14 06:57:32 Man, this is shaping up to look awful. Riz Ahmed deserves better.
2018-09-14 06:58:27 LAME!
2018-09-14 06:59:51 Ugh,

The studio and the writers ripped the arms and legs off this movie, it's just gonna roll down hill
2018-09-14 07:00:18 Lol I thought we all knew this was gonna be trash from the moment it was announced 
2018-09-14 07:00:27 LAME!!!
2018-09-14 07:00:45 PG-13?  Really?  I don't even know the source material but I do know that he is an R-rating character.  And given the amount of R-rated films killing it at the box office and considering how much people would hate a PG-13 rating.  Why?
2018-09-14 07:01:45 That is great news. Now i can bring my 4 year old.
2018-09-14 07:02:47 dammit
2018-09-14 07:03:21 aw man
2018-09-14 07:04:45 I really don't get how a studio can fuck up venom. Let alone continually fuck up venom. This movie should be the easiest comic movie to make.
2018-09-14 07:06:35 I hear the follow up movie will be a PG Venom vs. Carnage.
2018-09-14 07:06:39 Doesn't matter really, as ling as it's good
2018-09-14 07:07:15 Boooooooriiinnnggggg
2018-09-14 07:07:27 How the fuck do you have Carnage in a movie rated pg 13 smh
2018-09-14 07:08:38 Boo
2018-09-14 07:09:47 Maybe they’re holding the R for a carnage movie
2018-09-14 07:09:50 lame
2018-09-14 07:10:39 Venom without Spidermam? Strike 1

PG-13 rating? Strike 2

Come on WB, you can still fail me yet.
2018-09-14 07:11:39 Are there any r rated super hero/ villain movies out there?
2018-09-14 07:11:49 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2018-09-14 07:12:03 aww :(
2018-09-14 07:12:32 I was really on the fence about seeing it but I'm out now. Fuckin dumb. Don't say it's going to be R rated then change it later. This means it was filmed as R and will be heavily edited. 
2018-09-14 07:12:53 Welp! FUCK THIS MOVIE!
2018-09-14 07:13:33 All of my excitement for this film is now gone lol
2018-09-14 07:14:43 Another turd in the wind
2018-09-14 07:16:05 Dude so much of this movie feels wrong and I want it to be good with all of my heart and soul 
2018-09-14 07:16:36 There went the last bit of hope
2018-09-14 07:18:51 Boooooo
2018-09-14 07:19:23 Why as re we still here? 
Just to suffer?
2018-09-14 07:20:17 This movie is actually coming out? I thought it was just going to be a preview in theaters for all eternity.
2018-09-14 07:20:22 Well that's bullshit
2018-09-14 07:21:01 Hey, Sony....”Knock, Knock.  Let the devil in.”
2018-09-14 07:21:07 NOOOOO why cant it be R smh
2018-09-14 07:22:19 Well Sony it was fun while it lasted. 
2018-09-14 07:22:32 Well, this movie isn't gonna be good.
2018-09-14 07:22:59 Half his face is fangs. What screams PG13 about that? He looks like a freakin nightmare. I hope this doesn't neuter the film
2018-09-14 07:23:16 lame
2018-09-14 07:24:17 What the fuck are they thinking 
2018-09-14 07:24:30 Fuck8kg assholes
2018-09-14 07:25:25 Wated Aw for scawy imagawy.
2018-09-14 07:25:33 Lame
2018-09-14 07:25:58 What a turd in the wind.
2018-09-14 07:28:05 *Chances of me going to see it drastically dropping*
2018-09-14 07:28:09 Boo
2018-09-14 07:28:14 Awww, I was really looking forward to a really crazy Venom. Guess it's gonna be a little less crazy now... Lame. 
2018-09-14 07:28:29 Like a turd - in the wind.
2018-09-14 07:28:33 https://youtu.be/AjZuGas6yRQ
2018-09-14 07:29:19 Epic fucking fail
2018-09-14 07:29:26 I find it funny that a movie like Eighth Grade was rated R, preventing the audience for whom it was made from seeing it, BUT YET this film, which is supposed to be a violent and gruesome entry into the MCU, gets a PG-13?  Unreal...
2018-09-14 07:29:27 Jesus Christ why? I don’t want a soft venom movie!
2018-09-14 07:29:32 My interest level has...hmm... what's the opposite of piqued?
2018-09-14 07:29:37 Lol
2018-09-14 07:29:45 But it should be rated R :( why they do this?
2018-09-14 07:29:50 And we wonder why 13 year olds are so messed up. Desensitization at its finest. 
2018-09-14 07:31:21 I'm outraged because of course blood and swearing are the most important parts of making a good movie.
2018-09-14 07:31:40 Venom is one of those movie you would expect to be rated R. 
2018-09-14 07:33:06 Looks like Sony has finished putting all their nails in this coffin.
2018-09-14 07:33:08 I dunno you guys it looks pretty cool to me
2018-09-14 07:33:25 We all know it is going to suck regardless of the rating.
2018-09-14 07:33:53 Now thats a sign of a shitty disappointment of a movie from me dog
2018-09-14 07:34:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p1VFwzhy9Y
2018-09-14 07:34:28 YOU FUCKING COWARDS DAMN YOU 
2018-09-14 07:34:32 sounds like it's gonna be a disappointment then. venom should definitely be an R rated violent as fuck and brutal movie. 
2018-09-14 07:35:38 PEEGEE TURDTEEEEN
2018-09-14 07:35:59 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamd dead.
2018-09-14 07:37:02 I’m shocked! Shocked I say!

Well, not that shocked.
2018-09-14 07:37:19 haha
2018-09-14 07:38:31 Lame
2018-09-14 07:39:15 :(
2018-09-14 07:40:42 Bummer
2018-09-14 07:42:15 Booooooooo
2018-09-14 07:43:20 Yeah.. I'm not keen. 
2018-09-14 07:44:00 And this movies is not trash... GG Sony 
2018-09-14 07:45:39 I mean they can say fuck twice in the movie and it’ll still be PG-13
2018-09-14 07:46:57 Sons of bitches! Shoulda been rated R 
2018-09-14 07:56:03 Thaths very interesting. It thuld be a thmathing thussesth.
2018-09-14 07:59:51 Well that’s disappointing. A Spidey appearance just might make up for it
2018-09-14 08:00:23 😩
2018-09-14 08:02:56 Bummer they aren't capitalizing on the R rated superhero movie field that deadpool is monopolizing 
2018-09-14 08:03:05 So is this in any universe at all or just standalone? Lol I would love to see Tom Hardy in the MCU
2018-09-14 08:03:41 I'm so upset I just might write a letter to lee stan
2018-09-14 08:04:49 Welp, its gonna be crap.
2018-09-14 08:04:52 Is this the onion? Wtf?
2018-09-14 08:05:17 FUCK
2018-09-14 08:05:50 Missed opportunity. 
2018-09-14 08:06:17 WEAK
2018-09-14 08:06:56 If so, so I'm not going to watch it
2018-09-14 08:07:09 shocker
2018-09-14 08:09:10 Sony can't make movies. This surprises nobody. 
2018-09-14 08:09:55 Nope.
2018-09-14 08:11:43 Aww man
2018-09-14 08:12:43 Well, that's lame AF.
2018-09-14 08:12:49 So I guess he's not gonna eat anyone :/
2018-09-14 08:12:58 BOOOOOOOOOOOOO9
2018-09-14 08:13:06 Smart move. The movie is probably so fucked anyway, so they might as well just get their money from all the kids out there while they still can...
2018-09-14 08:13:43 A non r-rated Carnage just invites a Riot... 
2018-09-14 08:14:01 After seeing the success for dead pool, they still are afraid to make an r rated movie. 
2018-09-14 08:14:41 I was hoping it would be kinda like Deadpool. I'm disappointed.
2018-09-14 08:14:51 Screw this crap. I want an R-rated venom
2018-09-14 08:15:05 Boo
2018-09-14 08:15:18 There goes the hope of ever seeing Carnage :( 
2018-09-14 08:16:59 When you upvote news because it's relevant and you needed it, but your emotions are telling you to downvote because of the content.
2018-09-14 08:17:29 I always wonder if the studios ever browse Reddit. I would love for them to see this comment section. 

It just doesn’t make sense!! It should be graphic as hell. 
2018-09-14 08:17:30 sony, stop making shitty superhero movies
2018-09-14 08:17:48 Booooooooo!!!!!!! 
2018-09-14 08:18:03 And now I’m concerned 
2018-09-14 08:18:07 Well that is a bummer but expected 
2018-09-14 08:18:47 Man...I was really hoping for some Deadpool-tier violence.
2018-09-14 08:19:07 Well that’s unfortunate
2018-09-14 08:19:26 So in other words, it's gonna suck.
2018-09-14 08:20:11 Lame
2018-09-14 08:20:35 Lame
2018-09-14 08:20:58 This is literally cutting the nuts off a movie. 
2018-09-14 08:21:11 Venom officially receives a reserved spot on my "Do Not Watch" list
2018-09-14 08:21:18 ...and Batfleck is in it.
2018-09-14 08:21:56 Hollywood needs a set of balls. 
2018-09-14 08:22:28 Lame
2018-09-14 08:22:46 Dammit. My parents probably won't let me see it.
2018-09-14 08:22:55 Goodnight, sir. 
2018-09-14 08:23:04 Coincidentally, thats the rating its going to get on Rotten Tomatos. 
2018-09-14 08:23:07 I was on the fence about this movie. Not anymore. 
2018-09-14 08:23:26 I’m surprised people were expecting it to be rated-R, they would of been crowing about the R rating off the bat when they announced the film to build up hype.
2018-09-14 08:23:50 WAAAAACCKKKKKK
2018-09-14 08:24:07 Oh for fudge sake.
2018-09-14 08:24:08 Lame
2018-09-14 08:24:16 Well this went to shit too.... Nice job... 
2018-09-14 08:25:28 That’s disappointing
2018-09-14 08:26:00 Annnnd I'll just watch it at home then.
2018-09-14 08:26:18 Lame as fuck.

Well I’m already ready for a reboot.
2018-09-14 08:28:48 Wow I literally couldnt care less about seeing this now. 
2018-09-14 08:29:33 Well....i think it's safe to say.... We are disappointed 
2018-09-14 08:29:40 Please, everyone, don't worry. They'll eventually release the unrated special edition with four minutes thirty two seconds of violence and a half dozen fucks edited back into the movie. Just not until after you stream a rental on your console. And buy the Blu Ray of the theatrical edition.
2018-09-14 08:30:09 This movie is going to be a pile of trash
2018-09-14 08:30:19 I was already mostly uninterested, now I'm totally uninterested, and Venom was my favorite villain when I was a kid. 
2018-09-14 08:32:53 Wont be seeing this one in theaters then
2018-09-14 08:33:44 Pg-13 ahhhh not interested. Really I don't why pg-13 movies don't call my attention.
2018-09-14 08:35:55 Of all of them?!
2018-09-14 08:37:19 Booooo
2018-09-14 08:41:00 can't say i'm not disappointed.
2018-09-14 08:41:14 Venom officially confirmed to be disappointment.
2018-09-14 08:42:14 FUCK NOOOOOOOOO
2018-09-14 08:42:17 BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  


not surprised but still....BOOO!
2018-09-14 08:43:19 Not what I was promised
2018-09-14 08:43:39 I can't wait to not ever see it, and watch videos about how bad it is.  Its going to be so bad its "amazing".
2018-09-14 08:45:13 My disappoint is immeasurable and my day is ruined
2018-09-14 08:45:30 After seeing the trailers, do you think this movie will tank?

the cgi doesn’t look good
2018-09-14 08:49:42 That’s lame
2018-09-14 08:50:11 Venommmm venom venom venommmmm venmmmm fuck that song I’m drunk
2018-09-14 08:50:56 This will inevitably fail in the most epic fashion that only Sony can do.... what a huge mistake.. hopefully this just means Marvel can take it over after they shit on it and completely redo it.
2018-09-14 08:51:58 Venom officially loses one theatre going customer.
2018-09-14 08:52:46 Really hoped this would be R rated. 
2018-09-14 08:54:16 Wasnt the whole point of keeping venom seperate from the MCU so they could make it rated R?

Didnt they say when the movie was announced that it was going to be rated R?

Why am i steaming rignt now?

Am i going to die?
2018-09-14 08:54:23 Wack.
2018-09-14 08:55:50 Lame 
2018-09-14 08:55:52 Oh no.
2018-09-14 08:57:39 That's retarded.
2018-09-14 08:59:44 I’m eddy bwok 
2018-09-14 09:02:04 As long as Carnage is rated R, idgaf 
2018-09-14 09:06:31 Whelp. So much for that.
2018-09-14 09:12:57 Sigh. Maybe they'll give Venom the movie he deserves in my lifetime. This won't be it though. 

Not. Even. Close.
2018-09-14 09:13:18 Guess I'll be skipping this one then.
2018-09-14 09:19:10 Booooooo
2018-09-14 09:19:19 This news changes my thoughts on what the movie will be like now. It's going to turn out to be a lot less psycho of a Venom than I originally expected I can guarantee that.
2018-09-14 09:21:26 Well that was a quick way to kill this movie. 
2018-09-14 09:21:26 So the eminem song for this movie has more swearing then the actual movie.... 
2018-09-14 09:24:44 Release your inner baby.
2018-09-14 09:27:44 Flubber! 
2018-09-14 09:31:17 Easiest $200 I ever made. 
2018-09-14 09:33:53 Here i was not expecting a good movie to begin with. Anyone who had faith simply wanted to believe sony wasnt gonna fuck it up. 
2018-09-14 09:36:44 And now dies the flicker of hope I had for this movie. 
2018-09-14 09:37:27 Guess I'll wait to borrow a friend's Blu-ray of it 3 years after release.
2018-09-14 09:38:07 F
2018-09-14 09:38:20 Had such high hopes for this....
2018-09-14 09:39:41 I don't care that much about he movie is pg-13 I care that they need to do reshoot and re-edits to make it so.
2018-09-14 09:43:17 Maybe I am a Hollywood sweet summer child, but why don't they release an R-rated and PG-13 version?

2018-09-14 09:52:12 Well......RIP.
2018-09-14 09:58:43 Ugh
2018-09-14 10:01:15 Kinda surprised since at Comic Con there showed a trailer where he clearly bites a dude's head off and cuts a group of people in half
2018-09-14 10:02:07 boooooo...
2018-09-14 10:02:12 Haha count me out.
2018-09-14 10:03:12 Guess it's been decided for me whether I'll watch it or not. The only reason a non MCU villian movie should exist is for some dark and edgy storytelling. If I'm taking the whole family then we'll probably catch something else. 
2018-09-14 10:04:15 Is anybody surprised since Disney now has a strangle hold on marvel?
2018-09-14 10:04:28 Aaaaaaand there goes any interest I had of seeing it in theaters.

It's just another Marvel movie now, except without any heroes we care about, or any affiliation with the MCU.

See you on Showtime in 2019, Venom!
2018-09-14 10:05:40 LAME

2018-09-14 10:10:31 Ughhhhhh fail fail fail fail fail
2018-09-14 10:11:04 I can't wait for Marvel's Venom movie that actually has Spider-Man in it.  
2018-09-14 10:14:28 You'll get your rent when fix this d*** door!
2018-09-14 10:15:30 Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2018-09-14 10:16:30 I am disappoint...
2018-09-14 10:17:30 It was always about the toy sales anyway.  
2018-09-14 10:18:08 WACK
2018-09-14 10:19:46 Wait people pay attention to these ratings?
2018-09-14 10:21:11 Wack
2018-09-14 10:25:21 Darn it
2018-09-14 10:26:23 Wuss
2018-09-14 10:26:53 Wondering why he maintains spidey look if he never comes in contact with him?
2018-09-14 10:27:16 I’m gonna go out on a limb and just wait for the reviews to hear if it’s good or not. Seems pretty fucking dumb to argue about how shitty a movie is before anyone has seen it. 
2018-09-14 10:30:48 Fuck!
2018-09-14 10:35:55 lol what a fucking joke.


I just find these superhero movies so fucking boring.

Deadpool was a nice addition. But Logan convinced me that the market exists and there is no going back. If a character is dark - PG-13 just doesn’t fucking work properly.

A PG-13 captain America is completely reasonable. How is Venom going to fit into this?
2018-09-14 10:45:28 Fucking hell.
2018-09-14 10:45:56 Booooooooo!!!
2018-09-14 10:46:12 can't it be next month already..patiently waiting

05-10-18 release date.
2018-09-14 10:49:04 I can't wait to not see this movie.
2018-09-14 10:49:43 sooooo boycot venom since sony doesnt know how to make a movie or have balls to be like deadpool
2018-09-14 10:52:08 I felt like down voting the post but then I realized my dislike was misdirected... wtf marvel. Venom, is VENOM!! He’s dark he’s mean and he might just be pure evil... definitly not pg13. That’s not a nice box for venom to try to fit In. I mean I’ll still watch it cause it’s venom but shame it’s not gonna reach it’s fullest potential. They should take more risks. They have enough money to flop.
2018-09-14 10:54:28 God dammit, I had hope this would be an r rated awsome movie like Logan
2018-09-14 10:58:00 so it will be another movie for children. 12+ rating for Germany.  Really tired of this. I want 18+ movies back in cinemas.
2018-09-14 10:58:13 Yeah but did they fix his Elmer Fudd voice
2018-09-14 10:59:59 Pg13 is pretty much G now.
2018-09-14 11:10:33 This is gonna tank so hard.
2018-09-14 11:20:35 For fucks sake
2018-09-14 11:22:19 uber pass
2018-09-14 11:36:00 Yeah, i’m not seeing this anymore. Tom Hardy or not, playing Venom or not, this put the final nail in the coffin for me.
2018-09-14 11:37:06 I’d imagine this is to appease Chinese government censorship 
2018-09-14 11:37:13 Aaaaannnnd I’ll be renting this one boys. 

For a nice drunk movie night where my expectations are very low.
2018-09-14 11:39:56 Downvote me if you actually gonna go sit through this one.
2018-09-14 11:44:02 Venom officially just became less interesting.
2018-09-14 11:45:57 So did they confirm that carnage will not be in the movie or at least not have a big role. Because no one in their right mind could manage a half accurate representation of carnage without an r rating.
2018-09-14 11:48:19 What a fucking travesty. 
2018-09-14 11:50:28 Aaaaaaaaaand hype gone.
2018-09-14 11:53:54 A little surprising to me imo, doesn't really matter, but I thought the trailer looked like it might be a bit too graphic for this rating.
2018-09-14 11:55:06 Noooooooo...! And now it’s Alien Vs. Predator all over again. 
2018-09-14 11:56:16 Welp... it's going to be awful. 
2018-09-14 12:10:32 Sony continues its quest to make a film that nobody asked for and isn't aimed at anyone.
2018-09-14 12:10:44 Literally read every comment with the typical SP commentator voice. Well played... well played...
2018-09-14 12:18:57 It was nice while it lasted. 
2018-09-14 12:19:48 This gives me hope that it will connect to the marvel cinematic universe 
2018-09-14 12:26:53 Booo
2018-09-14 12:27:53 Welp not going to watch this now
2018-09-14 12:32:21 Seeing as teens and kids are the main audience for anything superhero related I’m not surprised. It still sucks though.
2018-09-14 12:35:03 Rating systems were invented back when pearl clutching boomers thought that rap music was evil and the gays ought not be seen on the screen. 

Just get get rid of them. Who gives a fuck
2018-09-14 12:37:04 Bad idea
2018-09-14 12:38:45 superhero superhero superhero movie new movie muh superhero
2018-09-14 12:42:56 This is a bigger let down than almost all of Marvel's anticlimatic villains except for Thanos the Mad Titan.
2018-09-14 12:46:10 This movie looks like it was made in 1997.
2018-09-14 12:51:24 So no boobs... Looking forward to intestines and and blood flying around though :)
2018-09-14 12:52:08 Sony... Do you need to talk to someone?
2018-09-14 12:58:41 In the article the writer gives as a reason for the PG-13 rating the fact that Sony are hoping at some point to either tie Venom in with the Spider-Man or greater Marvel universe. I understand the commercial reasons for this but it’s so damn frustrating. Why can’t they just try to make the best movie for the sake of its own worth.
I’m not saying that an R rating would specifically make this movie better but if the writer is correct and they’ve purposefully limited themselves to a PG-13 for this reason well then I’d be worried about the finished film. 
2018-09-14 13:05:02 I'mma try to optimistic about this.   The movie in all likelihood is gonna blow,   so at least we don't have to deal with super cringy attempts at it being Edgy ^^^^*fuck* ^^^^*batman*
2018-09-14 13:09:50 I thought the whole idea of finally making a Venom movie came from how well Deadpool and Logan did?
2018-09-14 13:10:28 ok, first of all

- Made by sony movies, Sign of quality..  

- They are trying to make a SEU without spiderman

- Its fucking sony

- It they are trying to make a action horror film and its PG13

- Did i mention its Sony and everything they touch turns to shit ?

This movie is DoA


2018-09-14 13:12:50 Womp womp
2018-09-14 13:16:11 nope. it's over with
2018-09-14 13:19:44 Venom looks like a friendly happy guy.  I could be friends with Venom. 
2018-09-14 13:28:25 best 
2018-09-14 13:37:24 This film is gonna be like a turd in the wind!
2018-09-14 13:39:15 I was looking forward to seeing this in theater. Guess I'll wait till it streams free. 
2018-09-14 13:40:35 I feel freeeee
2018-09-14 13:41:20 Aw yes the final nail in the coffin. 
2018-09-14 13:42:27 Fuck sony
2018-09-14 13:42:41 Fuck sony
2018-09-14 13:44:05 Venom, Semi-lethal Protector.
2018-09-14 13:48:08 Maybe Carnage will be R. 
2018-09-14 13:49:57 New Fortnite skin sketch
2018-09-14 13:52:25 They're afraid to take risks.  Seems likely it will bomb sadly
2018-09-14 14:01:57 Screw you Hollywood, screw you...
2018-09-14 14:41:45 Garbage 
2018-09-14 14:44:16 Gay
2018-09-14 15:01:11 uf, pure posion then. My only hope is Spawn now.
2018-09-14 15:05:07 Ha, awesome. 

You know, if Sony Pictures would just get over themselves and let Marvel Studios make them money, I bet we could have some pretty great movies. But nooooo, Sony Pictures just has to keep shooting themselves in the foot. 

Hell, you'd think by now that after so many god-awful movies, there'd be no feet left at all for Sony Pictures to shoot. They'd just be balancing on weird bloody stumps, holding a gun and looking sad because there's all these bullets and no targets to aim at. But wouldn't you know it, they just keep finding a shred of foot left, and then they gleefully lock and load before shooting it right the hell off. 

...that metaphor got away from me, but the point is that this movie looks awful and I hope it bombs because maybe, *just maybe*, they'll learn this time.
2018-09-14 15:13:52 this movie is DOA. no spidey, no R. no venom
2018-09-14 15:14:00 The best Tom Hardy. PG-13 Tom Hardy. 



Might end up skipping this one. 
2018-09-14 15:16:57 Well, nevermind. I won't be seeing it in theaters now.
2018-09-14 15:17:54 That's going to be a no from me then
2018-09-14 15:19:21 Bloodless Venom?  Hard pass.
2018-09-14 15:20:40 You know how i know youre gay? 
2018-09-14 15:24:23 Annnnnnnnnd it sucks. 
2018-09-14 15:27:49 cast tom hardy as venom then make it PG 13 
2018-09-14 15:29:20 Venom, is officially a movie I *WON'T* be paying to see in theaters.
2018-09-14 15:37:44 Nail in the coffin.
2018-09-14 15:44:13 Threatens to eat most of a man's body and turn him into a potato in the trailer. Screams PG13 to me...
2018-09-14 15:48:06 Welp, looks like they didn't learn. Again.
2018-09-14 15:48:53 Oh no.
2018-09-14 15:56:04 Booooo!!!
2018-09-14 15:59:22 I don’t think Venom needs to be rated R, but I thought the point was to ride the wave of Deadpool’s R-rated success. Did Sony get cold feet and change it to appeal to a wider audience? Because if so, that’s lame.
2018-09-14 16:03:37 This seems to be a problem with the American rating system. There isn't a middle ground between PG13 and R where as in Australia we have G, PG, M, MA15+ and R. It may only be 1 extra rating, but it really would help to have an M for you guys to avoid the censoring needed.
2018-09-14 16:16:43 Cringe.
2018-09-14 16:20:29 Upsetting. I mean I guess but I was hoping for something darker and gritty 
2018-09-14 16:25:47 fuuuuuck that
2018-09-14 16:28:02 We all know that they did this so they can make a bunch of money off the “R - rated Directors cut” after video release. 
2018-09-14 16:28:02 Ooooooo dis gun be bad.
2018-09-14 16:28:04 Uh I can't wait for the one additional fuck in the R-rated home release!

/s if it isn't obvious. 
2018-09-14 16:43:24 Look, I grew up with PG-23 Venom. In the Spider-man PS1 game he was cool, funny, and scary and the worst thing he said was "freak".

The PG-13 rating is not the bad thing about this. It's the fact that they are trying to make him all edgy without understanding the character. The symbiote picks up a lot from Spider-man, so in that sense Eddie is like a murderous quipper. He does bad things with a weird grim amusement. I like the part in the trailer where he says everything but the infamous "turd" line. That isn't the problem. The issue is that it's completely at odds with everything else the trailer shows.

Venom simply has to be tied Spider-man. Otherwise it isn't Venom. 
2018-09-14 16:49:06 I actually have hopes for this movie. But then again it's part of the Spider-Man universe so I really should have expected it.
2018-09-14 16:50:47 Well then whats the bloody point.
2018-09-14 16:53:21 Wow I'm very shocked about this news! No one said.
2018-09-14 16:53:24 who cares, 13+ will also get scare once he/she sees trailer midnight with lights off on mobile with full volume
2018-09-14 16:54:43 Oo so I don’t need to see this movie is what you are saying?
2018-09-14 16:56:52 Pass.
2018-09-14 16:57:53 Eminem made a Venom song that is clearly not PG-13. God Damn it I was excited because of that.
2018-09-14 16:58:09 Wonderfuly retarded!
2018-09-14 16:59:37 Have we not learned our lesson on this
2018-09-14 17:01:08 I have read a lot of comments that hate this because they expect to see blood after certain violent acts.

And I get it but at the same time I do not. Is the color or a red liquid so vital to the enjoyment of the scene? We still gey the violent act just not the blood.

Why is this bad? Is violence purism a thing?
2018-09-14 17:07:11 Hoping they release an R-Rated Bluray then.
2018-09-14 17:07:54 Booooooo!!
2018-09-14 17:08:32 They had to work very hard against the grain to do that. Which means they believe the younger audience, which doesn't know Venom is more valuable/important than the older audience which definitely knows him.

Such a dumb fucking company.
2018-09-14 17:09:49 If anyone actually believes an R-rating increases a movie's chances to be good, they are a complete, an absolute complete idiot. 
2018-09-14 17:10:38 It’s going to suck, what happens next; they release Carnage, it gets a PG rating?
2018-09-14 17:16:44 Whelp, at least we know this movie is definitely gonna suck.
2018-09-14 17:17:08 Sony phones sucked and died, Sony TV's sucked and died, Sony movies suck and will die. Sony PS4 is alive because the games are not made by Sony.
2018-09-14 17:19:14 That's too bad
2018-09-14 17:27:20 Well, I can't say I'm in any way shocked.
2018-09-14 17:33:35 Pussies
2018-09-14 17:48:47 Thought we already knew this 
2018-09-14 17:50:07 Just waiting for E for Everyone Carnage movie...
2018-09-14 17:50:12 Aaaaaand I lost any fucks I gave 
2018-09-14 17:52:18 NOOOOoooooo!
2018-09-14 17:55:19 lame. It eats people.
2018-09-14 18:06:22 shame.
2018-09-14 18:08:58 Booooooooooo!!!!!!!

2018-09-14 18:13:27 This movie should be a hard R like Deadpool.
2018-09-14 18:14:59 I was surprised that some people thought Sony might actually do something brave, that company is build on taking ideas from other people and play it ridiculously safe. 
2018-09-14 18:22:34 So much for that
2018-09-14 18:23:33 Just to note Tom Hardy movies ("no one cared who I was until I put on the mask") where he dons a mask usually are well received.... unless Venom will break the streak. 
2018-09-14 18:28:47 Guess this means Carnage isn't in it.
2018-09-14 18:32:21 Lame. "Upgrade" the better version of this Venom movie, was rated R. 
2018-09-14 19:06:01 Venom looks awesome but after watching the trailer to the movie Upgrade they are basically the same movie. 
2018-09-14 19:07:59 Boooooo
2018-09-14 19:09:18 Fail
2018-09-14 19:25:14 God. Why oh why? Why must Sony consistently backhand the characters of the comics? Why would Venom be a PG 13 rating. I know this rant is in a vacuum, as there is no way they'll change it, but why oh why?
2018-09-14 19:27:46 So are we back to making this a Zombieland-like horror comedy?
2018-09-14 19:31:21 Ya!! A toned-down anti-hero movie! Exactly what the fans have been asking for, and showing up to watch for the last few years....
2018-09-14 19:38:07 Disappointing :(  
2018-09-14 19:38:10 Thanks Sony.
2018-09-14 19:47:54 Too bad, well at least I know I don't need to bother seeing it.
2018-09-14 19:49:51 ._.
2018-09-14 19:52:09 Booooo
2018-09-14 19:53:34 This is so shocking
2018-09-14 19:54:13 Dark PG13 movies always do great
2018-09-14 20:00:58 Not unexpected. Trailers didn't scream R rated to me at all.
2018-09-14 20:46:43 at least I can go see it without getting my sis to buy tickets ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-09-14 20:50:08 This went from "wanting to see it the day it came when out"  hen I first heard about it, to seeing it "within the first few weeks" due to how they pronounce symbiote to "lets wait for the redbox" after the rating. What a wild ride this movie is turning out to be. 
2018-09-14 21:08:15 This will be the rare instance where the lead actor would have been better off sticking to DC rather than jumping over to "Marvel".
2018-09-14 21:19:32 Genuinely curious, has there ever been a good horror movie rated pg 13?
2018-09-14 21:28:09 If this bombs badly what are the chances of Marvel getting the rest of their IP from Sony?
2018-09-14 21:40:02 Meh. I didn't really have high hopes for this anyway. Pretty sure it's going to be more Tom Hardy than Venom for the duration.
2018-09-14 21:59:09 I was super hyped for Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, since that's the type of Venom I like.

I was willing to look past the bad CGI of the symbiote arms coming out of his body if it got an R rating.

Then they do this. I'll still go see the movie, because I'm a fan of the character, but I'm not going to be as happy about it as I would have been otherwise.
2018-09-14 22:02:51 Pussies
2018-09-14 22:55:33 All this film is a set up for the inevitable Spider-Man vs Venom movie.
2018-09-14 23:18:32 Venom will suck confirmed.
2018-09-14 23:52:26 A star is born vs Venom...hard decision for me. But i think I'll past on venom
2018-09-15 00:11:14 Unfortunate, but it was obvious with how quiet they were being about it
2018-09-15 00:33:16 They'll probably have the inevitable "unrated" version out on digital and home video when the time comes. Classic double dip.
2018-09-15 00:43:39 The post-credit scene has Carnage giving Venom a big hug. Oh wait, a guy hugging a guy would push the boundaries of PG-13. How about Carnage gives Venom a high five.
2018-09-15 00:43:45 Venom PG-13 rating. Strike 1, 2 and 3. You are out!

Venom without Spiderman? Greyhound bus back to the minors!

Whose bright idea was it to center a trilogy around venom? Venom is a great supporting character and foil for spiderman. A one off movie to get him into the spiderman lineup makes sense. A franchise around venom is silly. 
2018-09-15 04:53:55 Logan gave us too high of a benchmark.. Venom deserves the red-stuff!
2018-09-15 05:07:17 This is gonna be such a shit movie. The trailer is fucking awful, and this just solidifies it really.
2018-09-15 05:52:28 Why are ratings so stupid here in the US. Most 13 years old know and talk about and see shit like fuck, sex, blood, violence, etc. 
2018-09-15 06:05:48 I mean would venom's goo powers be inherently all that R-rated anyways? I mean don't get me wrong, I'd like to see them be creative and have him chomp or rip apart a guy.
2018-09-15 06:48:19 Didn't anyone pay attention to Deadpool? You can make a ton of money with R rated superhero movies *as long as they are good*.
2018-09-15 07:13:01 This is going to suck so hard lmfao
2018-09-15 08:19:55 And the sound of a toilet flushing echos across the land.
2018-09-15 09:45:15 Fartfuck
2018-09-15 12:17:26 Fuck off. 
2018-09-15 14:23:45 I can't imagine what goes through Sony's execs heads when they execute every single bad decision to make a film. 
2018-09-15 16:35:59 Other Marvel movies has blood. Why change this one.
2018-09-15 18:27:21 But why?
2018-09-15 18:30:33 fail! they chickened out!
2018-09-16 06:34:59 Does reddit really think an R rating automatically makes a movie good and a PG-13 rating makes a movie bad?
2018-09-18 15:32:06 You know, I had many many bad feelings about this movie. I didn’t think it’d be good but I still wanted to go to it in the hopes it’d be rated R. A fitting rating for Venom. But no.

I’m still gonna see it to give it a chance but come on.
2018-11-29 02:46:46 I recently saw Venom in theaters, and it was just fantastic regarding the overall violence and swearing level. It wasn't watered down, the action was fine. An R rating would take away the popularity of the film, and it would be inaccurate. Carnage needs an R rating when he hits live-action, however.
2018-09-14 07:53:29 Why are you people screeching about  this? The Wolverine was rated PG-13 too. 

Stop freaking out, give the movie a chance before shitting all over it, for fucks sake.
2018-09-14 01:10:30 Bummer.

Still gonna see the shit out of it opening night.
2018-09-14 01:25:38 BOMB.
2018-09-14 01:19:38 Didn't Hardy say he'd be upset if it ended up with a PG-13 rating?
2018-09-14 01:45:32 Honestly, it doesn’t even matter if it was R-rated. Kids would’ve gone to watch it anyway like they did with Deadpool. 
2018-09-14 02:46:24 To be fair... They fucked the first 3 spiderman movies so hard they did a full reboot within a decade. 

Guessing it's their business plan? Male everyone hate it for a decade and then reboot it? I dunno..
2018-09-14 06:25:12 Why does America go straight from PG13 to R18+? From my understanding, most of the rest of the world has an in between rating...
2018-09-14 06:15:18 This is a marketing scheme. Wider audience in cinematic release, then they can release the R rated blue ray and get more money
2018-09-14 06:39:22 What am I missing here, why does everyone already know the movie will suck? I really liked the trailer I saw (#2?) and thought Hardy's acting looked great. I think PG-13 can be done well although obviously its trickier, but if the only basis for being so negative is just 'I wanted it to be R-rated' that really sucks because attitudes like that can sink movies that are just fine, then the studio freaks out and tries to give us more fluff and re-boots that don't need done.
2018-09-14 02:16:01 Like a turd in the wind
2018-09-14 03:29:19 Go fuck yourself, Fleischer. Definitely won’t be seeing this in theaters now.
2018-09-14 03:57:43 And like that the chance of me seeing this went from 5% to 0% 
2018-09-14 04:02:15 I wonder how much other movie studios hate marvel right now. Cause if it weren't for marvel most of the public wouldn't know what a good comicbook movie even was..let alone multiple good comicbook movies.
2018-09-14 04:03:40 Gritty  superhero movies are way more interesting :/
2018-09-14 04:03:43 Bullshit
2018-09-14 04:47:21 The other shoe just dropped 
2018-09-14 04:50:29 I'd stopped collecting comics when Venom started getting popular but if I recall, he's more of a rated R kind of guy.
2018-09-14 04:52:02 They just cut venoms balls off
2018-09-14 04:53:29 Would be better R
2018-09-14 04:58:02 Welp, there goes that
2018-09-14 04:58:11 Well im less excited now
2018-09-14 05:21:42 Ah ok so they ARE trying to fail? Cool
2018-09-14 05:25:00 Mediocre comic book movie gets aimed at kids. More news at eleven
2018-09-14 05:40:22 Bloodless kills here we come. <Slashes throat> <falls to ground with no blood spray>
2018-09-14 05:59:55 I was hopeful for something darker and more adult, I worry this is just gonna be like spider man 3 now 
2018-09-14 06:04:39 Doesnt the villain have AXES FOR HANDS?? How is this going to pan out? Ultraviolence *just barely off screen?* Are they going to do the Ragnarok thing (which was a great movie) and just have hundreds of victims with literally zero blood? How are they going to do this? Doesnt the main protagonist **fucking eat people?????**
2018-09-14 06:34:58 [deleted]
2018-09-14 06:36:15 To express my disappointment. I will not see this movie in theaters. 
2018-09-14 06:49:42 I was watching an ad of  this while half asleep yesterday. Tom Hardys voice got on my nerves because  he sounds like a teen trying to do a bad impersonation of Christopher Walken.
2018-09-14 07:15:38 It's dead then.  That's a death sentence for a movie like venom.
2018-09-14 07:18:43 As soon as I heard "turd in the wind", I knew this film would be just that.

It's really sad too, because Venom has been my favorite hero since grade school.

Edit: Yeah, fuck my opinion. 
2018-09-14 07:26:23 I mean.....the dark Knight (2008) was also pg-13.
I'll wait and see how it goes. 

2018-09-14 07:38:34 Must not have screened well.  Marvel films needs to end so this is fine.
2018-09-14 07:45:53 How fucking lame
2018-09-14 07:46:54 So you’re telling me the song Eminem made for the movie wasn’t enough to push it to R?
2018-09-14 07:48:15 On the bright side, his garbage, unintelligible voice might make it hard to focus on the hammy dialog.
2018-09-14 07:48:33 They just provided more fodder for Deadpool 3.
2018-09-14 07:48:49 This should be rated R only 
2018-09-14 07:48:50 Sweet! I can go see it with my 13 year old now!

/s
/sssssssss
2018-09-14 07:49:21 Annnd it’s officially on my do not see list 
2018-09-14 07:54:58 This movie will be like a turd in the box office.
2018-09-14 07:55:32 This is prob going to suck
2018-09-14 07:56:25 Rip
2018-09-14 07:56:43 F THAT
2018-09-14 07:56:52 Yikes
2018-09-14 14:31:26 Welp, this just in “Missed Opportunity or Why an R rated villain movie about one of the arguably scariest Spider-Man villains (behind Carnage) would’ve been great” coming soon to disappointment near you.
2018-09-14 14:40:15 Huge Venom fan, and yeah this movie is gonna be bad
2018-09-14 17:40:03 So the PG-13 rating is because the studio wants to maximize its money making ability to, maybe, get Venom in the MCU?  Smelling like an expensive turd already.
2018-09-14 17:40:57 Dead on arrival....
2018-09-14 17:44:35 Yikes.. had really high hopes for this movie, especially when I heard they were casting Tom Hardy.. I thought the trailers didn’t do the movie justice at all, and this might be the final nail in the coffin..
2018-09-14 18:00:27 Love Tom Hardy but I hope this flops.
2018-09-14 19:12:49 R
2018-09-14 19:21:54 Well, looks like I know what movie I'm not going to see.
2018-09-14 19:34:47 Venom reminds me of Suicide Squad. In both cases, I thought the trailers looked like absolute shit but for some reason, they got a ton of hype and people set their expectations fairly high. 
2018-09-14 19:34:54 Wont be seeing it anyway. Seems an odd Tom Hardy career choice, this will be a major flop. His accent is off as well. 
2018-09-14 20:12:00 Venom was my favorite character growing up. This movie looks SOOOOOOO bad I don’t think I’ll even bother seeing it
2018-09-14 20:33:31 Wait.... Did people actually expect this to be rated R?
2018-09-14 00:16:01 While i was hoping for R, i think PG13 makes sense, you can go pretty far in PG13 in terms of violence and etc . That said, also makes a lot of sense if they plan on him entering the MCU at some point. 
2018-09-14 04:19:12 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

&#x200B;

No seriously who didn't see this coming? PG-13 is how movie studios think they'll get that capeshit money. Don't worry, we'll get the real movie in about 2 years when they release the uncut version on DVD
2018-09-14 19:45:15 Gonna flop. Tom hardy is a very bad pick for this movie :( 
2018-09-14 20:07:09 Hhahaha.  I'll wait until Red box or maybe netflix if at all.
2018-09-14 09:24:01 It will officially be terrible then. Thanks Disney
2018-09-14 03:04:46 Oh no, kids will get to go watch kids films. You man children need to grow the fuck up
2018-09-14 04:49:33 People who are obsessed with R rating are just looking for an excuse to say a movie isn't good.

Logan wasn't good, I think the R rating was a disservice to it, most of the F-bombs were useless.
2018-09-14 05:06:00 Why can’t they release 2 versions of movies at the same time?
2018-09-14 05:20:13 Lets go Kids,the movie of blackspiderman  is waiting for you
2018-09-14 05:26:51 Definitely skipping this one now
2018-09-14 05:32:03 Its nice of the movie industry to tell us in advance not to bother, saves me like $15.
2018-09-14 05:32:30 Fail, not watching
2018-09-14 05:33:10 lol
2018-09-14 05:33:44 yea looks like ill be watching dis shit online for free
2018-09-14 05:42:29 u/Alextingzon 
2018-09-14 05:53:06 I'll just feel bad for Hardy if this movie blows, the dude is too good for this treatment

2018-09-14 07:37:42 Lame and boring.  NEXT!
2018-09-14 07:38:21 And here I thought "turd in the wind" was a poke at the Marvel Universe. The First Avengers movie being directed by Whedon. His other movie being Serenity, the line being "like a leaf in the wind". 
2018-09-14 07:40:41 Bwut I was hopwing we would fwinally get a well made venom to watch.

2018-09-14 07:54:04 I always know about the ratings in movies, but can someone explain to me why this is a big deal as supposed to being rated R?
2018-09-14 08:36:41 Well there goes my interest.
2018-09-14 08:56:32 To be completely honest this isn't a huge deal to me. Venom was my favorite comic book character growing up in the early 90's. Had that hologram cover #1 of his first solo shit and a stack of Spidey comics with him in them. The character, although possibly terrifying visually, was far more about internal struggle and imposing fear than gratuitous violence. It isn't like Punisher or Deadpool getting PG-13. My taste has changed plenty since then but the kids deserve an anti-hero/villain that's bad ass too.
2018-09-14 09:55:50 Unless you bring Carnage into the mix (which they're not doing), I don't get why so many people here seem to think Venom belongs in an R rated film. 

He's had his violent, mature moments and stories, but it's not like say, Wolverine or the Punisher, for whom an R rating almost seems like a necessity. Venom remains a Spidey villain, and as such he's had just as many (if not more) moments of being much closer to PG-13. For a while he was even more of an antihero, protecting innocents and cracking jokes. You can make a really adult, dark story about Venom, but you're really not forced to at all, it's really not that obvious to me.

That said I still have extremely low expectations for the movie, I have a feeling it's gonna blow (like a turd in the wind). I'm just saying that I don't think the age rating would be to blame here.
2018-09-14 11:12:34 [deleted]
2018-09-14 12:28:37 I like how nobody is reading the article. The article specifically debates the rating and suggests that it's not the end of the world, and includes two examples: one R-rated shit film and one PG-13 good film.

Why must you guys be so quick to judge? Just wait out. When the movie rolls out, you still have a few days to look between critics and peers before you go to the theatre.

Jeez.
2018-09-14 12:55:31 It was trash from the first trailer
2018-09-14 12:56:03 Guess i wont waste my money then
2018-09-14 14:39:14 Ugh no longer want to see this but I expected this.
2018-09-14 19:56:24 I cant believe people have their hopes up after hearing the writing. 
2018-09-14 20:48:30 I don't understand why people care wither it's R or PG-13. Who cares if you're not getting the gore. Take it or leave it in my opinion. As long as the story/acting is good and convincing, that's all that matters.
2018-09-14 01:22:20 [deleted]
2018-09-14 02:26:02 Half the people complaining about this film are still going to pay to see it. The only way Venom truly comes back to the MCU is for everyone to stay home and pass on this obviously-rushed cash grab.
2018-09-14 03:39:55 There goes the one thing the idiots defending this movie claimed was the reason it was good to not be connected to Spider-Man at all. "ooh we get to have r rated Venom now Marvel wouldn't do it justice Whoo".

This was obvious from the start. If they were gonna go r rated they would have marketed the shit out of the fact as soon as they possibly could. The whole campaign would have centered around it. 

By the way the symbiote absolutely works just fine with pg-13. Doesn't change the fact this movie, Sony, Avi Arad and Amy Pascal can go fuck themselves. This whole thing is such a huge slap in the face as a Spider-Man/Venom fan. Whole thing feels like some stupid shit from 2003.

I can't help but feel Marvel Studios is to blame here too because I find it hard to believe Sony didn't talk to them at all about introducing the symbiote and for whatever reason they said "nah we don't want to incorporate a fan favorite element of the Spider-Man mythos that could span a half dozen movies" so Sony said "uh okay if you don't want it I guess we'll have to do our own thing". There has to be more to the story of why we can't have proper symbiote saga. 
2018-09-14 04:16:18 Just because Venom gets a PG-13 rating doesn't mean it's bad. Only time will tell if the movie is actually bad or not. I'll probably still watch it, unless the movie is said to be very bad.
2018-09-14 17:45:48 Gay. And not in the homosexual way. But in the like, this is retarded way. And not in the mentally handicapped way.
2018-09-14 06:51:41 Dammit yall quit bitching you bunch of babies 
2018-09-14 08:33:39 Why did this have to be R??? Yall need an "adult" movie to validate your nerdy interests? PG13 does not mean dead on arrival, you all just want this movie to fail for some fucking reason
2018-09-14 03:21:48 Is anyone really surprised? This always felt like a PG-13 movie to me. Just because Deadpool worked doesn't mean every studio is suddenly going to jump on board.
2018-09-14 05:09:06 Ruined. No way a PG-13 movie about Venom can be even remotely good, the end.
2018-09-14 06:56:53 I don't see what the problem is, still gonna watch it.
2018-09-14 11:26:05 Why is any one surprised?? It’s marvel! Doesn’t matter if it’s also Sony it’s still a marvel superhero/villain movie lmao
2018-09-14 03:25:04 Reddit makes no sense. Everyone saying it being Pg-13 ruins the character and it has to be R for the character to be done right. But then want Marvel to take it over like they are going to do a Hard R Spider-Mam/Venom movie
2018-09-14 04:01:54 Reddit had already judge, jury, and executioner'd this film.  Usually means it will be pretty good.  
2018-09-14 06:32:36 Venom doesn't need to be R rated I don't know where people get that idea from. None of the comics were mature rated.
2018-09-14 08:23:58 Wow, I mean what kids would want to see a super hero movie? Super heroes are ONLY for adults. Outrageous.
2018-09-14 17:50:59 Being obsessed with movies getting an R rating is boring and lame and cringey. This movie looks like dog shit either way. 
2018-09-14 07:18:06 I'm going to see it. I don't care. I just want to watch Tom Hardy. He's a god. 😍
2018-09-14 08:39:25 Guess I'll be taking my son to this. That's great! And all the folks in the top comments being whiny teenagers can go fuck themselves. Love it.
2018-09-14 05:54:13 Of course it did. Anyone thinking it was gonna be R is delusional and/or an idiot. 
2018-07-31 17:10:06 "The world has enough superheroes"


Is much better than

"embrace your inner anti hero"

Edit: for those confused, the first venom trailer had the anti hero line as its tag line 
2018-07-31 17:16:49 [deleted]
2018-07-31 18:13:06 The villain is NOT Carnage, it’s Riot.

EDIT: *For those asking, Riot is going to be the main villain of the film (with its host being the CEO of Life Foundation, Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed), but that doesn't mean that the other four symbiotes (Scream, Lasher, Phage and Agony) aren't going to be there as secondary antagonists.*

*Scream is in the trailer. Her host, Donna Diego (played by Michelle Lee) can be seen slowly morphing into Scream around* *1:54*.
2018-07-31 17:23:42 Is it me or does he sound like Mike Tyson at the start
2018-07-31 17:54:11 Prediction of the day: Third act is a big gooey mess. 
2018-07-31 17:09:16 Tom Hardy doing his best Fenster from Usual Suspects impression.
2018-07-31 17:27:13 Seeing and hearing Venom really makes me want "The Darkness" as an adaptation. 
2018-07-31 17:23:54 Two Venom trailers have now been released with no mention that Woody Harrelson is actually in this movie.
2018-07-31 17:44:55 That "turd in the wind" line is very telling.
2018-07-31 17:09:22 Not being able to understand Tom Hardy under a face covering part 100.
2018-07-31 17:41:17 "In association with Marvel", just hammering home the fact that Marvel Studios isn't responsible for this.
2018-07-31 17:16:12 > The world has enough superheroes

Well that's a better tagline than "Embrace your inner antihero" 

Also they fix the symbiote pronunciation apparently
2018-07-31 17:39:15 Imma need subtitles for this
2018-07-31 18:13:53 This trailer strongly reminded me of the Prototype game, which was incredibly dumb and amazing fun. Something about how the symbiote cover moved, and the hand-blades, just minor stuff, but, yeah, basically I really enjoyed Prototype :D

Hopefully the movie can deliver the same!
2018-07-31 17:02:53 Did he call that dude a turd in the wind?

I can barely understand a single thing he’s saying. Venom OR Tom Hardy. 
2018-07-31 17:07:24 Why is Tom Hardy doing an impression of a toddler? What is that accent supposed to be?
2018-07-31 17:10:07 However this movie turns out, the Venom design is awesome!

Tom Hardy's ~~accent~~ Elmer Fudd impression is *interesting*
2018-07-31 17:13:34 Spidey wouldn't understand a single fucking thing this Venom is trying to tell so it's good to have separated universes
2018-07-31 17:21:08 I really hope it's just the editing of the trailer for why Tom as Brock sounds so... choppy. I refuse to believe that's how his character actually speaks.

That said, didn't understand a damn thing he said as Venom, so at least that's a standard when it comes to Tom Hardy.
2018-07-31 17:28:39 Not excited for a villain fight that'll look like slightly off-color pools of gasoline slapping each other
2018-07-31 17:56:59 Why does Tom Hardy sound like Dunkey?
2018-07-31 17:26:03 The dialogue in these trailers continues to be awful.
2018-07-31 18:26:40 "Human beings are disposable"

I'll take clues he might be the bad guy for $400, Alex
2018-07-31 17:13:29 I cannot say I'm sold by this.
2018-07-31 17:37:23 I got some Amazing Spider-Man 2 flashbacks when guy in a suit who is obviously a villain showed up
2018-07-31 17:22:55 So the dialogue/script is an absolute trainwreck from these trailers so far it seems.

It LOOKS cool, venom definitely looks and sounds the part.

But I don't think that'll be enough. The writing feels so bad right now. 
2018-07-31 18:27:46 Is it just me or does Eddie sound a little mentally handicapped? Maybe its the basic as hell dialogue, but Hardy seems to be playing the character as a version of Warrior's Tommy Reardon, that got hit in the head too many times.
2018-07-31 17:16:53 This movie is kind of frustrating to me, because absolutely everything about Venom himself and the action look incredibly cool and stylish. But the dialogue and whatever that weird accent/acting Tom Hardy is doing seems to be atrocious.

I'll probably watch this expecting some fun moments, but an overall poor movie.
2018-07-31 17:14:38 Oh, good, another movie where I have no fucking clue what Tom Hardy is saying. 
2018-07-31 17:15:51 Venom looks absolutely terrifying. Whether this movie is good or bad, that design for Venom is just fantastic. The fact they also got the Venom eating people thing down is great as well. 

Also, it definitely looks like Venom is gonna have a very good amount of time in this movie. Not only showing up in the last 15 minutes, like those rumors suggested.

EDIT: also, this movie is definitely rated R. No way it wouldn’t after showing blood coming out of the guys neck that Riot cut.
2018-07-31 18:17:17 "What are you?"

I'm guessing like me, he couldn't understand a single thing he was saying so he went for the easier question. I would've straight up asked the fuck he just said
2018-07-31 17:11:56 I was with it until that final scene, Venom in a brightly-lit convenience store making jokes didn't gel well with the rest of the trailer at all. Hoping it's not a huge tonal mess
2018-07-31 17:56:50 I'll wait and watch a supercut of all the Venom parts on YouTube.
2018-07-31 17:50:29 Holy shit this dialogue is fucking painful. Tom Hardy's monologue at the beginning could be from a Neil Breen movie. 
2018-07-31 18:45:46 What's the point of having a 10 second teaser at the start of a 3 minute trailer?
2018-07-31 18:46:50 This looks more it might be a movie adaption of the Prototype games rather than a Vemon movie. 
2018-07-31 17:50:52 It feels like this movie will be "Upgrade" with a higher budget and superhero trademarks. However I think, at the end of the day, "Upgrade" will be a better movie than this weirdness.
2018-07-31 17:43:29 I think Venom looks pretty awesome but this looks not good.
2018-07-31 20:17:52 Looks cool, but you know what would make it really good? *Spiderman*
2018-07-31 22:41:21 I want an audiobook with Venom's voice.
2018-07-31 17:12:33 What the fuck is this accent? Why does he sound like a baby half of the time?

And that scene at the end... the delivery is off, Hardy looks bored. It looks like a bad rehearsal not a scene in a blockbuster movie. 

The first trailer was meh but this one is just awful.
2018-07-31 17:49:04 Sony's marketing team is still going with the "show the whole movie in the trailers" strategy from Amazing Spider-Man. And the movie seems to be doing the protagonist vs antagonist with same power set again. 
2018-07-31 17:13:05 I've seen enough hentai to know where that tongue scene is going...
2018-07-31 18:40:27 This trailer has huge spoilers. Now I know that there will be two parasites, and one of them will be grey and belong to the bad guy. 

RIP 
2018-07-31 19:16:33 This movie feels like it is set in same world as The Amazing Spider-Man, still grasping on to that failed attempt at an extended universe. 
2018-08-01 01:46:20 The worst crime is they actually gave critics the quote to use in the trailer itself: "turd in the wind".
2018-07-31 18:50:57 I wish Sony would stop making movies. 
2018-07-31 22:43:04 Okay, the script might be godawful, but are the voices really that hard to understand for anyone else? I understood pretty much everything both Venom and Eddie said. Sure, they aren't good, but they're not spouting indecipherable nonsense like most of the people in this thread seem to be saying they are. 
2018-07-31 18:05:56 So at some point, Venom fights another symbiote that is colored dark grey? That's got potential to be very confusing. Weird choice, especially because in the comics most of the symbiotes other than venom are brightly colored.
2018-07-31 21:21:49 Wow... This looks.... Pretty awful
2018-07-31 19:03:56 [deleted]
2018-07-31 20:46:25 [Ahhhh...much better](https://imgur.com/a/r1s570e)
2018-07-31 17:46:04 ...What the fuck is this villain’s plan?

You could say this about ANY bad guy but I honestly don’t understand Venom’s.
2018-07-31 18:28:12 Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock reminds me of Charlie Day in Always Sunny.  I can't stop seeing it, or expecting a cut scene to "The Gang Becomes Super Villains."  
2018-08-01 01:33:52 I don't like this Venom film because it omits the backbone, the driving force, of the Venom character - Peter Parker. Hell, the only reason the Venom Symbiot looks the way that it does is due to it's intense envy of Spider-Man.
2018-07-31 18:41:10 I want to like it, but I don't see Spider Man and that's a problem for me.
2018-07-31 19:15:16 This fuckin dialogue. How do these people have jobs?
2018-07-31 21:51:06 “EAT YOUR FACE... Like a turd in the wind”

SO fucking bad. Why would they do this. This movie has such potential, I just hope they don’t pollute the whole thing with dopey one-liners meant to keep the 8 years olds giggling through the movie. 
2018-08-01 01:14:14 What the fuck kind of tone is this movie going for? The last scene made Venom seem really comedic, especially with him using the word turd.
2018-08-01 05:29:45 I wanted a Vemon movie all throughout my childhood and now that it's here I couldn't care less. 
2018-07-31 17:43:14 I think this is yet again an example of how Sony doesn't understand what they're doing.  This looks to be Fantastic Four bad.  I really hope I'm wrong but the whole point of the symbiote's powers and resemblance to Spidey is that he (Spiderman) had the symbiote first.   This makes it seem like Spidey doesn't exist and Venom was "born" in a vacuum.  
2018-07-31 18:17:16 I wish I was excited for this, because I really like the character of venom and I have been ever since I saw him in that animated Spider-Man show as a kid, but this movie looks really fucking wack honestly. The use of Venom as a character seems almost inconsequential, it could just as well have been a Prototype movie, or a completely new character, it really wouldn't have made any difference... this just feels like a studio using a property they own, simply because they own it, not because anyone really thought they could tell an interesting and worthwhile story with it. 

Unless this movie surprises everyone and ends up getting really good reviews I'll definitely be waiting till they dump it on Netflix.
2018-07-31 18:40:11 I'm not happy with what I see about this movie. It might be fine, but too much has been changed. Not connected to Spiderman, not an alien, no indication that the symbiote chose him due to his character. However, I will reserve judgment until I see it.
2018-07-31 18:10:33 I’m having a really hard time understanding what Venom is saying... Like, at all. Is anyone else having this problem? Anyone know what he’s saying in the trailer?
2018-07-31 19:58:24 Just give Marvel the goddamn rights! :(

I just want to see Venom and Spider-Man in the same cinematic universe in a movie or two that does the characters justice, I struggle to ever get excited about Sony owned productions these days.
2018-07-31 18:41:05 Someone watched the Upgrade trailer.
2018-07-31 18:26:34 I think my anticipation for this film is almost completely gone. Crap writing, shoddy CGI, tonal issues - it seems like not only have Sony not learned anything from Spiderman 3 or either of the Garfield movies, they've doubled down on them. Unless this trailer is massively misrepresenting this movie, I think this is gonna flop hard.
2018-07-31 18:36:43 Got a Prototype vibe when his arms turned into scythes.
2018-07-31 17:26:16 If Venom eats someone, who digests it? Venom or Brock? If Brock, does that make him the victim of forced cannibalism?  


Also, kind of wish Venom didn't have a British accent.
2018-07-31 17:16:08 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:47:22 This could be another for the netflix pile
2018-07-31 21:25:51 Kinda makes me think of the "The Darkness" games 
2018-07-31 21:35:34 This is actually getting me hyped for the future “Carnage” movie in 2022. 
2018-07-31 22:52:39 Pros: Venom looks fantastic. His proportions are right and his voice is actually pretty good.

Cons: The tone was a little all over the place, hopefully the final cut drops some of the humor for more horror elements.

Will I see it? Yeah, probably
2018-07-31 17:14:44 Holy crap the CGI was horrible when he's clashing with the other Symbiote
2018-07-31 17:01:25 Even if this movie absolutely sucks, Venom looks fucking amazing

"I have a parasite" hahahaha brilliant
2018-07-31 17:15:47 Yeah... Still looks like a tough sell to me.
2018-07-31 17:34:46 I have a feeling this trailer showed us pretty much every scene with Venom in it. 
2018-07-31 17:36:21 There's literally no reason for this movie to exist. It wasn't enough to ruin Daredevil and Ghost Rider, but Venom too. Goddamn you, Sony.
2018-07-31 17:07:25 Fuck everyone, I’m actually excited for this movie. Venom is awesome.
2018-07-31 17:42:46 If I pulled that symbiote off would you die?
2018-07-31 17:50:54 Do American ambulances have "救护车" written on their doors or something? Are they trying to imply that they find the symbiote in China lol?

Also, where is this movie set? There are shots of the London skyline even though the movie is probably set in the States.  

2018-07-31 18:51:51 A turd in the wind? What a bizzare insult
2018-07-31 19:15:14 I still think that for most movies, if it can't be an entertaining stage play without most effects than it shouldn't be a movie. This dialogue seems so immature it is ridiculous. It doesn't have to be Shakespeare but it also doesn't have to be a 5th grader writing it. 
2018-07-31 20:02:27 Had to stop watching half way thought. I don't want to see another full movie trailer. Looks promising though.
2018-07-31 20:47:37 Did he say like a turd in the wind?
2018-07-31 21:15:57 Like a turd in the wind?


That’s.....a bad line
2018-07-31 22:19:40 I feel like this trailer pretty much gave up the plot of the movie. Is that normal?
2018-07-31 23:34:57 Why is Tom Hardy talking like a baby?
2018-08-01 01:43:53 Is it just me or at least 25% of the dialogue is "We are Venom"? Who does he think he is? Groot?
2018-08-01 01:53:09 This looks more like a Prototype movie then a symbiote movie.

So I'm just going to go into this thinking it's a Prototype movie
2018-07-31 17:13:47 Just passing by to check how much r/movies is going to nit-pick this trailer
2018-07-31 17:41:44 Remember how people said they loved the look of the Amazing Spiderman 2 suit and based their judgement of the movie solely on how it looked? then the movie came out and was crap? I am seeing a pattern here....
2018-07-31 18:04:34 And I thought Bane was a little hard to understand...
2018-07-31 18:47:07 Tom, you’re a multimillionaire. Treat yourself to some elocution lessons.
2018-07-31 19:21:07 i'm getting some serious Prototype vibes 
2018-07-31 20:11:43 “We are VENOM, bum bum bum bum bumbumbum!”
2018-07-31 20:29:02 If this isn't rated R it wont even be worth watching. Slap an R on that and I am there. It needs to have the Logan treatment with exploding bodies otherwise the lack of blood will make this movie a joke
2018-07-31 20:45:47 The end battle scene pretty much spoilered away the entire plot. Evil Corp CEO envies the power of the guy who got his powers/suit, so he makes the exact same (add slight color variation) for himself, and then they fight. 

Iron Man had to fight Evil Iron Man

Flash fought like 5035745764 evil speedsters, because if you have speed powers, every villain that shows up will have speed powers so it's convinently easy to write the plot.

The list goes on. 

Really disappointed this will turn out to be the same, and Evil Corp CEO is the one who is going to be the enemy image of the movie, instead of the main character (Venom / Tom Hardy). I can already see it:

"He isn't the hero we deserve, he is who he need when nobody else would get his hands dirty". 

Oh man I'm sad.
2018-08-01 00:28:05 You can hardly understand what the dude is even saying. Shout out to Riz Ahmed for saying simbiote correctly though, that last trailer drove me up a god damn wall. Hate to join the circlejerk, but it looks like this is going to suck. That Venom suit does look fantastic though, really liked the scene where he says “look into my eyes” and forms his face off of Eddie’s hand. 
2018-08-01 03:56:38 Am I the only one that could understand everything perfectly fine?  I am also pumped to see this movie.  
2018-08-01 05:36:28 this looks incredibly awful
2018-08-01 11:45:20 movie still looks fucking terrible 
2018-07-31 17:26:42 Why does this movie look like such shit? And man, how does the symbiote effects not at least come close to the one from the Raimi version? I'm not talking about the Venom portrayal, but the actual symbiote as a special effect, looking like [individual hands and muscle tendons crawling up on you full strength](https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-spider-man-3/full/spiderman-3-movie-screencaps.com-7638.jpg?strip=all) Here it looks like melted glue and don't come up to me saying that's how it looks in the comic. There's a difference between a comic strip and a room full of effects artists and art directors. Everything symbiote looks like a pre render. What makes me mad is that some scene concepts look nice but I feel like it's lacking in the render department. Like the venom crawling out of him to literally speak to him could have been cooler it it looked less like floating glue. That final shot could look gorgeous and ominous, but there are like...5 render passes missing. What the hell. And the overly clean cinematography isn't helping. I wish it looked like [Black Swan](https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/201/0-black-swan/full/black-swan-movie-screencaps.com-10021.jpg?strip=all) or [prometheus](http://www.digitaldingus.com/reviews/hd/0020/prometheus_fullres_3.jpg) with a bit of grain to the image in order to add to the horror and unsettling aspect, to the atmosphere. Might even hide some of the less good effects

Hell let's go back a decade ago. A fucking decade! This shit looks horrifying and **visually interesting**:

EDIT: That final trailer joke-ish interraction was streched out way to fucking long! You either  put that shit in the beginning or you cut it short damn it!
2018-07-31 17:11:30 Not sure how this will turn out but at least Venom looks great!
2018-07-31 17:59:49 This looks like it should be released straight to the SyFy channel
2018-07-31 18:07:41 Venom looks fucking amazing.

Whatever the other flaws this movie has is to be seen, whether it's shitty story and plot, piss poor dialogue or lack of raison d'etre sans Spider-Man you have to admit, Venom looks menacing and terrifying.
2018-07-31 17:33:23 Slightly unpopular opinion, based off what I’ve been reading here: I actually like it. Sure it’s not perfect and the dialogue for Eddie seems off, but other than that, the symbiotes (especially Venom) look fantastic and the movie looks like fun.
2018-07-31 17:07:51 This looks absolutely hilarious
2018-07-31 17:25:20 I swear I need subtitles for every movie with Tom Hardy in it. He isn't too hard to understand here but he sure sounds weird with whatever accent he's trying. 
2018-07-31 18:26:39 This is going to be a tough watch.
2018-07-31 18:34:56 Am I the only one that doesn’t get why they make 2 trailers for movies nowadays?? I don’t want half the plot to be spoiled for me before I go see it. 
2018-07-31 18:40:56 I can barely understand a word venom says
2018-07-31 20:47:40 So the Venom symbiote has gone from "insane space demon" to everyone's favourite villain cliché; "humans are not evolved enough, but I, Science Man, will make them evolved in a mad way that nobody will like".

This is guaranteed shite. 
2018-07-31 17:23:06 Yeah this doesn't look good. At all.
2018-07-31 17:37:45 What's that accent tho, I feel like I'll need to have subtitles on every time I watch a movie with Tom Hardy on it. 
2018-07-31 17:48:19 I really really like the McFarlane/Michelline inspired look. Very big toothy smile but not a mess of sharks teeth he devolved into.
2018-07-31 17:49:17 This is similar to that movie Upgrade coming out soon, Tom Hardy even looks like Logan Marshall-Green long lost twin.
2018-07-31 17:57:35 Venom is basically Upgrade with questionable CGI
2018-07-31 17:59:22 To everyone complaining that they can’t understand what venom is saying, most theaters have either a box thing you put in your cup holder (AMC) or glasses you can wear (Regal) that relay subtitles during the film for you. After discovering this 5 years ago I don’t see any movie without them. Just go to the service desk and ask for a closed captioning device. 9/10 times they have one and are always free of charge
2018-07-31 18:00:21 Looks like a great October release.  I’m liking the horror movie superhero spin
2018-07-31 18:36:15 This looks bad. Riz Ahmed deserves better than this
2018-07-31 18:41:11 Maaaan, I was hoping the villain wasn't just another 'Venom' type character. It might be hard to watch the two fight, especially with the dark tone of the movie. 
2018-07-31 18:43:03 As a huge Spider-Man fan, I'm excited for this. I didn't have a hard time understanding Brock or Venom and the ending scene fits with the character. Venom makes dark humor jokes all the time in the comics.

Been watching to see who the other symbiotes are. It's tricky cause symbiotes can change bodies at will if they find a better host so some of this can be misdirection.

But looks like there's Riot, Scream, and Toxin. Then I'm guessing there will be a Carnage reveal at the end so they can tie it in with the other movies. 

Maybe a Morbius/black cat/venom team up?
2018-07-31 18:45:56 I hwave a pawahsite ms cheen. 
2018-07-31 19:04:43 Well, that was way better than the first one
2018-07-31 19:05:56 Well shit. That looked way fucking better than the last trailer. WAY better.
2018-07-31 19:29:29 I may need to read up, but I always thought Venom was a villain to Spider-Man, as a host of Eddie Brock... What is the story here? Seems like there's only villains?
2018-07-31 19:49:43 I think I'm going to like this movie. Not like I liked The Winter Soldier or Infinity War, but the way I like Spawn.
2018-07-31 20:02:25 Nothing is certain but death and Tom Hardy having some shit on his face. I really like the trailers which usually means it will be really good or it will be another Suicide Squad. 
2018-07-31 20:18:02 This is probably the closest thing we'll get to a Prototype movie. 
2018-07-31 20:52:10 Wonder if the lady will still pronounce it Sym-Bi-Oat.
2018-07-31 21:41:37 Makes me wanna go play prototype. 
2018-07-31 23:04:46 Venom was my fav villain from the time I watched the Spiderman 1994 cartoon. 
2018-08-01 00:52:37 Man this looks cool.  

Side note, the shot at 1:24 looks like it could be straight out of the games based on The Darkness.
2018-08-01 01:32:37 What does he say at the end?
2018-08-01 01:49:26 [deleted]
2018-08-01 02:03:25 Looks like a Sony movie....terrible
2018-08-01 02:38:19 This was the coolest trailer I've seen in a long time. Venoms design is fucking amazing and that shot of him holding that guy by the neck in the street made giddy. Can not wait for this.
2018-08-01 05:48:01 Okay, this trailer killed any excitement I had to see this film.
2018-08-01 06:53:12 Legitimate question here - is anyone else bothered by the fact that this is a classic SPIDER-MAN villain that is not going to be interacting with Spider-Man? Nor will he ever interact with him as long as Disney owns the rights to Spidey and Sony owns Venom? Like are they allowed to mention Spider-Man? I would be much more excited for this movie if I knew someday it could parlay into a Holland / Hardy, Spider-Man / Venom movie. But it won’t. So I don’t really know what to think. :/
2018-08-01 10:47:26 “Like a turd in the wind” the best movie monologue line since Blade Runner’s “Tears in the Rain”
2018-08-01 10:47:52 Just a reminder that the writers of 50 shades of grey wrote this
2018-08-01 13:18:30 I'm getting flashbacks to 2015 after I watched the Doomsday trailer for Batman v Superman.

I was kinda optimistic about this but this trailer doesn't really help the movie look very good imo. 
2018-08-01 14:30:08 i find this completely boring. im just testing if i finally managed to disable predictive text and auto correct since the last fucking samsung update.
2018-08-03 06:40:41 Tom Hardy just isn't a good actor. He's overrated but Hollywood keeps giving him big action movie roles. He just doesn't have the acting chops or the charisma that most action stars have - he's bland, lack of emotion, and simple. I seriously can't buy him as Eddie Brock, he's a miscast like Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor.



2018-07-31 17:25:18 I am generally okay with changing characters a bit for adaptations, but that's just not Eddie Brock. 
2018-07-31 17:18:48 This movie is going to flop so hard
2018-07-31 17:53:28 this looks so bad
2018-07-31 17:07:21 Venom looks badass
2018-07-31 17:07:47 This looks rather mediocre. And Venom doesn’t look that great at all. The CG is still a bit wonky. 

And can anyone explain to me what accent Hardy is supposed to be doing? He sounds weird. 
2018-07-31 17:14:22 Fuck everyone. I'll see it and enjoy it.

Don't @ me
2018-07-31 17:21:07 As a Glasweigan, I did not expect to see an aerial shot of my city at [0:40.....](https://youtu.be/xLCn88bfW1o?t=40s)
2018-07-31 18:41:44 I can't understand what the fuck he's saying. 
2018-08-01 05:37:40 This looks awful in every possible way.  Mumbled dialogue you can't understand.  Terrible, cringeworthy writing.  Horribly fake and ugly video game CGI.  A messy third act fight between characters you can't tell apart (at night no less).  And the entire thing is utterly empty without the presence of Spider-Man.  Venom is his foil.  He was always written that way.  Sure he's a popular character, but if you strip away that connection, he's not nearly interesting enough to stand on his own.  I may be proven wrong when it hits, but without Spider-Man this is just going to be a boring, hollow, forgettable monster movie.  "Turd in the wind" sums it up pretty aptly.
2018-07-31 17:46:34 This trailer isn’t horrible but I still can’t justify watching a Venom film without Spidey. Venom is definitely not that interesting on his own. 
2018-07-31 17:16:06 Heh. Looks like fun. A very 90s and pre MCU superheroes movies feel. Venom looks really good 
2018-07-31 21:30:44 I could hear Venom and Tom Hardy perfectly, I don’t get why everyone else can understand them.
2018-07-31 17:25:04 Fuck it, I'm watching it.
2018-07-31 17:47:17 Wow, this looks bad.
2018-07-31 17:22:53 HOOOOly sHIIIIT that looks terrible.The unintentionally funny moments in that trailer is off the charts. worse than the mummy(2017) trailer even.
2018-07-31 17:19:46 No matter how talented the cast are, this is just \*so\* disappointing... 
2018-07-31 17:11:54 some of the lighting here in regards to venom looks really, really off...

and oh boy, looks like the end will be venom vs EVILER venom. pass
2018-07-31 17:21:17 This looks like they are trying to be edgy and it's just coming off as wrong...
2018-07-31 18:04:46 I liked the trailer. I'm not going in expecting Infinity War levels of greatness but Venom looks menacing and they seem to be capturing it well. Ill reserve judgement for when I see it
2018-08-01 15:30:44 This honestly looks like it belongs in the 2005 era of superhero movies.
2018-07-31 17:25:35 Trailer looks pretty good to me, I think they nailed Venoms appearance and behavior. Dialogue could use some tuning so it's easier to understand.
2018-07-31 17:54:54 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:12:36 The CGI was sketchy in some shots, but looks good nonetheless. 
2018-07-31 17:07:48 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:34:37 THE WORLD HAS ENOUGH SUPERHEROES
2018-07-31 17:36:56 Tom Hardy sounds like he should be casted in The Room 
2018-07-31 17:46:13 Trailer definitely better than the first one, but still not enough to convince me that this is necessary. 
2018-07-31 17:47:00 Better trailer than the first one, for sure. But still hm, not quite there yet. I love Venom's design though the CGI could use more touchups.
2018-07-31 17:49:50 Talk about revealing too much in the trailer....yikes
2018-07-31 17:49:58 I feel like Sony just has lost any and all idea of how to create and promote films.
2018-07-31 17:53:59 Am I the only one that thinks that Venom looks like he did in Spider-Man:web of shadows?
2018-07-31 17:55:32 They could pull off carnage here if they wanted. 
2018-07-31 17:58:06 Ven ..umm So when will  hardy  actually make good movies ?? 
2018-07-31 17:58:08 Remember, they also had to fix  his voice in the Dark Knight Rises. 


https://youtu.be/dZW5qyc2g6U
2018-07-31 17:59:17 Ui, i am getting some Assasin's Creed Vibes...not a good thing
2018-07-31 18:00:56 Thank god it looks watchable! I was afraid for awhile there! 
2018-07-31 18:01:35 I just want carnage. Then I’m sold.
2018-07-31 18:02:10 Did I see Anti-Venom towards the end of the trailer? 
2018-07-31 18:03:04 Wasn’t Woody Harrelson supposed to be in this as Cletus Kasady? Carnage is one of my favorite villains (I should note NOT for the same reasons that one Reddit post had) and I’m kind of disappointed that this movie hasn’t shown a clear villain yet. 
2018-07-31 18:04:18 Anyone else feel like Hardy is taking some inspiration from the character he played in the drop, Bob Saginowski? I dig it, looking forward to this.
2018-07-31 18:05:33 Are they still shooting for the R rating on this one? 
2018-07-31 18:07:41 As a person who knows nothing about comic book Venom, who exactly is the slightly off coloured villain in this trailer?
2018-07-31 18:10:46 Maybe I'm not educated on the Venom universe, but that looked like a massive spoiler from 2:15 on... 
2018-07-31 18:13:27 Man, whoever edited that audio together in the beginning . . . phew.
2018-07-31 18:16:19 San Francisco huh, so we're getting Lethal Protector Venom? 

Nice. 
2018-07-31 18:20:45 I await Sony's trailer for *Springtime for Hitler* next.
2018-07-31 18:29:16 Looks OK. 
2018-07-31 18:31:56 never has a trailer looked so pg-13 before
2018-07-31 18:32:34 Looks friggin great to me!
2018-07-31 18:35:29 Okay, so that was neat looking, but it seemed substantially worse than the first trailer.  I am now a lot less interested in seeing this movie. that opening monologue was actively painful.  And I love me some comic book movies.  A lot.  But I am not feeling this. 
2018-07-31 18:35:55 The way they edit the beginning with his speech pattern, he sounds like Christopher Walken. 
2018-07-31 18:38:22 I just noticed something really jarring in the trailer too, at 0:14 he says "I always seem to find myself questioning the government" but after he says myself it sounds like they dubbed in questioning from a completely different part of the movie based on the background noise. They obviously tried to be subtle but my god that just doesn't fit
2018-07-31 18:42:24 Looks pretty good actually.

Question: Has Tom Hardy always had this different way of talking, like he, cuts his, sentences?
2018-07-31 18:46:27 Venom is my favorite comic book character of all time. I've likes him since I was a wee lad.

I'm going to keep my blinders on until I see this, no matter how cringey the dialogue is turning out to be.

Even his comic dialogie wasn't ever THAT bad. Cheesy, sure. But never that bad.
2018-07-31 18:47:58 Bruh i cant fcking wait
2018-07-31 18:49:07 I am now super excited for this.
2018-07-31 18:49:39 This looks a whole lot better than I expected. 

It's too bad I can only understand Benom and not Bom Hawdy
2018-07-31 18:50:30 I mean, you all can hate all you want with your peculiar criticisms, but that trailer was awesome. I'm back on the hype train.
2018-07-31 18:51:18 All I want for Christmas is for my boy Tom Holland to fight my other boy Tom Hardy in the MCU but Sony is the Krampus of the film industry and the battle of the Spider-Toms will just remain a fantasy 
2018-07-31 18:53:08 Woah. 
2018-07-31 18:53:50 It looks good but they didnt really need the reveal at the end there.

I was worried that we wouldnt see Venom until right at the end, but it looks like it happens quite early on in the movie.
2018-07-31 18:58:52 I want this to be good because I want to see a good movie, but I also want it to be bad because I want Venom to be part of the MCU...
2018-07-31 19:01:12 The comments in this thread have me seriously worried about everyone's listening comprehension and the suspension on that bandwagon they're jumping on.
2018-07-31 19:01:44 I'm definitely not paying to see this.
2018-07-31 19:02:34 I’m.....not following. I don’t understand why a lot of people are saying they can’t understand Brock or Venom talk. I mean, it’s a funny joke, but I myself can understand everything they both say, no problem. 

Not trying to go against the crowd. I just really think that issue is really over blown. 

Kinda feels like people just want a reason to hate the movie. 

I’m a huge Tom Hardy fan-boy, so I guess I’m a bit biased. I’m super hyped about the movie. 
2018-07-31 19:02:47 This actually looks pretty nifty! The first few trailers were super bland and generic but yes, this could totally be great now. I am excite. Also, I really *love* Venom's personality and also his design looks 10/10
2018-07-31 19:02:58 Based solely on the two trailers released - in my opinion this movie looks *not good*.

I feel like this latest trailer didn't help sway my initial feelings, which kinda sucks because Venom is my favorite character from the Marvel universe. I was cringing during the last scene where he's holding the guy up in the convenience store. Ugh.
2018-07-31 19:03:46 This does not look good. 
2018-07-31 19:03:53 Is venom even speaking English half the time? Didn't catch a word at the start of so many snacks, so little time. 
2018-07-31 19:04:32 I'm just going to say it.  This doesn't look good.  The villain being the CEO guy with another symbiote that barely looks any different than Venom is a really poor choice.  And other than Venom2 it looks like he's just going to be fighting guys with guns.  I feel like I've already seen this movie so many times.

I think we're all just tired of superhero movie's villains being a slightly bigger/stronger version of the hero (Iron Man/Warmonger, Incredible Hulk/Abomination, Man of Steel/Zod, Superman/Doomsday, Ant-Man/Yellowjacket, Captain America/Winter Soldier, etc.)
2018-07-31 19:06:42 This trailer actaully got me more interested. I think I'm going to see just for the actions. And I am glad I wasn't the only one who couldn't understand a single thing Venom was saying. I thought it was because I had volume on low on my phone.
2018-07-31 19:07:00 Was Venom difficult to understand to anyone else? I was struggling to figure out what he said. Especially during the last part of the trailer before he disposes of the guy I'm assuming is a robber. 
2018-07-31 19:08:45 Did they just show us the final battle and pretty much every point of conflict in the movie?

I fucking hate trailers.
2018-07-31 19:09:15 Seems like the first trailer didn't show enough Venom, but this latest trailer showed too much Venom. 
2018-07-31 19:16:53 Some of the ingredients of a good movie are in this trailer.  I still don't feel good about it.
2018-07-31 19:17:00 Whoever did he audio engineering for the trailer seriously fucked up. When Tom Hardy is speaking as Eddy I guess they tried to slow his voice down (for the DRAMA) but it left massive artifacting in the sound clip.

Who the fuck OK'd this?
2018-07-31 19:19:32 ...Still better than Spider-Man 3's Venom.
2018-07-31 19:19:52 Wasn't broke supposed to be a jerk before he had venom and then a total bad ass after? why is tom talking like he is in kindergarten and acting like he is scared? from what i remember from the comics, his confidence went thought he roof with venom, now "hey swat team, i'm scary now , please stay away"
2018-07-31 19:20:44 It was PAINFULLY obvious that "I always seem to find myself... QUESTIONING... something the government may not be looking at" is from three entirely different parts of the script.  It didn't even sound the same, but like the audio was simply slapped together.  Totally lazy.

Venom himself looks pretty cool though.  But seems to me the trailer is also totally revealing who Carnage is (if that is supposed to be a surprise in any way).
2018-07-31 19:34:32 Wonder how they gon explain why Venom looks likes Spidey...
2018-07-31 19:38:19 Just hand him over to the MCU already.  
2018-07-31 19:44:05 What are the chances those teeth are going to bite anyone in the movie? It's pg-13, right? Another harmless little cashcow? Spooky for 11-year olds and down, right?

Punisher and deadpool are literally the only superheroes in the world keeping it real right now. Everyone else is Mickey Mouse. Or did I miss anyone?
2018-07-31 19:46:04 Is nobody going to mention his arm turning into that goofy-ass puppet for him to talk to?
2018-07-31 19:59:31 Dark Grey Symbiote? Is that supposed to be Anti-Venom?
2018-07-31 19:59:46 Why do they always just pair these heros against "Bad bigger venom?" Why not a proper villain?
2018-07-31 20:02:12 Did I see a trailer before the trailer?
2018-07-31 20:04:46 The way I see it

This trailer shows too much 
2018-07-31 20:08:17 Ok am i hearing things ?
Everyone is saying they cant understand venom, but for hes the only one i understood ?
2018-07-31 20:17:48 Here we go. Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a journalist with a strong moral conviction and the dedication to pursue the shady government agencies ruining people's lives. Eddie hears that Agency X is doing something shady, possibly something to do with some kind of horrible weapon. He decides he must infiltrate the facility, using his journalism skills. 

At some point, he will be discovered, and either during the escape he gets covered in Venom, or he is caught and evil government uses him as an experiment. He gets loose, and has to learn to live with Venom.

Evil people are now tracking him down, and hurting people he loves. He MUST now take the fight to them. He will then dismantle their operation, where finally the main antagonist will face him, probably in the original site where Eddie was first paired with Venom. The movie could go two ways here:

Evil antagonist has discovered that sonic waves hurts Venom, and uses it, rendering the symbiote useless. Eddie will have to fight the antagonist on his own, until he can somehow disable the sonic weapon, at which point the symbiote will free itself and kill the antagonist.

OR:

Evil Antagonist reveals that another lifeform was discovered, along with the Venom one. He merges with it to create CARNAGE. Carnage and Venom fight, and eventually Venom wins (by using a sonic weapon to drive off Carnage, leaving the antagonist powerless).

After Credits Scene: Carnage symbiote is found by Woody Harrelson. It starts to merge with him and the scene cuts as the teeth are forming.
2018-07-31 20:19:25 Will Tom Hardy ever play a supervillain that you can enunciate?
2018-07-31 20:29:05 Why do trailers have teasers before them now?
2018-07-31 20:29:24 Am i the only one who thinks this isn't that far of a The Darkness movie, at 1:23 in the trailer it even looks like the darkness when it talks to Jackie.
2018-07-31 20:29:39 I was not a fan of the original teaser, but this trailer has changed my mind. It looks better than I thought.
2018-07-31 20:30:58 What does Eddie say at the end? "Oh, I have the power to save?" 
2018-07-31 20:33:25 Looks awesome but the trailer was too long and in my experience, long trailer = disappointing movie. Hope I’m wrong. 
2018-07-31 20:35:31 Finally a interesting superhero movie.

I'm getting tired of the pump-and-dump shit like Antman 2 or Black Panther
2018-07-31 20:37:16 Okay, I was really sceptical after seeing the first trailer but I'm sold.

It looks amazing, the juxtaposition between the symbiote and the calm demeanour of Eddie is really cool.

2018-07-31 20:37:46 1) Someone else in this thread has already made that joke about Tom Hardy being difficult to understand, so you don’t need to repeat it.  
2) Does anyone in here read comics? Especially Venom ones? You do realize that comics are full of corny dialogue, don’t you? 
2018-07-31 20:40:54 This trailer is lite.
2018-07-31 20:43:26 Eddie talks like a child with a speech impediment and it annoys the hell out of me 
2018-07-31 20:44:45 Jesus Christ! That opening dialogue is spliced from so many separate lines it's insane. I mean I know movie trailers do this to compress a narrative into a short space of time, but this example is over the top IMO.

>1. I'm Eddie Brock

2018-07-31 20:44:59 Fucking hell. This looks bad enough to be a DC movie. Ugh. 
2018-07-31 20:46:11 *At the 2:15 mark*

Hey, guys, I wonder how the movies gonna end...
2018-07-31 20:47:10 Needs:

1.) WAY better dialogue

2.) Refined CGI

If the dialogue sucks this much most likely the story does as well.

And Sym-Bye-Oat? Cmon. Who the fuck is making decisions over there? Get your shit together.
2018-07-31 20:47:48 Why did Sony rush this crap out?  I mean, did they not see the success of Spider-Man Homecoming and all the other MCU films?  They should have waited on this instead of trying to make their own “R-rated” super movie...
2018-07-31 20:49:38 Jaaackkkiiieeeee!!!!!!
2018-07-31 20:49:55 I cant remember the last time I was this uncertain about whether a movie would be good or not
2018-07-31 20:50:07 Boycot? Boycot!

\#VenomWithoutSpider-manIsAWaste
2018-07-31 20:50:18 I'm just glad they *finally* said Symbiote right
2018-07-31 20:50:30 This looks like a bigger budgeted, but worse, version of Upgrade.
2018-07-31 20:53:25 If nothing else, I sincerely appreciate that they've "corrected" the pronunciation of symbiote.
2018-07-31 20:56:21 Still not convinced. This movie just looks bad for some reason.
2018-07-31 20:58:05 Is it possible for CG to feel dated before it's released?

FIND OUT OCTOBER 5
2018-07-31 21:02:08 Who. Wrote. This dialog? 

I mean who actually wrote this?

> “I always seem to find myself...questioning something the government may not be looking at.”

> “I found something...really *bad*.”

>  “Turd in the wind.” 

Isn’t this supposed to be rated R? Venom would never say something so stupid. Also, is Eddie Brock supposed to have a speech impediment?


2018-07-31 21:04:31 I'm a reporta. For real though it's funny how similar this looks to Upgrade, which stars that guy who looks just like Tom Hardy. Not saying either ripped off the other. Just a strange coincidence. 
2018-07-31 21:05:10 This movie looks absolutely terrible.
2018-07-31 21:08:05 I can't believe they remade Upgrade already!
2018-07-31 21:09:29 This looks awful beyond words. 
2018-07-31 21:10:21 Favorite character as a kid and the movie looks like it'll be terrible.  Fuck you, Sony.  Haven't you ruined enough shit?
2018-07-31 21:10:24 Seeing a lot of hate on the trailer, all valid and I agree with basically all of it but I gotta admit that the design of Venom is pretty cool and I kinda love the twisted emotions in the face when he is talking about turning that dude into a turd 
2018-07-31 21:11:03 "I'm Eddie brock, I'm a reporter." 

He obviously doesn't have the spidey symbol, but it just looks so empty. 


2018-07-31 21:16:57 God damn this movie looks stupid. It'll be so hyped until release then it'll be a footnote of the comic book movie genre within 2 years.

But hey at least it'll make all those venom comics I spent $2 on back in the day go up in price by 10,000% so I can sell them
2018-07-31 21:17:34 This is going to be terrible, and it's such a shame because Venom looks absolutely amazing. WHY didn't they leave this character alone until Feige and the MCU decided to pit him against Spiderman? This is going to kill the character for audiences and bury any chances of him appearing in a decent movie alongside Spiderman.

Sigh...
2018-07-31 21:20:05 This looks....bad?
2018-07-31 21:21:26 This looks horrendous.
2018-07-31 21:21:47 What the hell? No idea why everybody is dissing Hardy's voice, I can absolutely understand what he's saying, seems like people are inventing a problem that isn't there. But I'm British, maybe that makes a difference.
2018-07-31 21:22:41 THAT GUY SAID "SYMBIOTES" CORRECTLY


HYPE HYPE HYPE!
2018-07-31 21:23:40 give me the darkness movie thank you
2018-07-31 21:24:56 Wow, The we writing in this movie better be way better than therse trailers are showing, or just as bad to worse. At this point I'm rooting for this movie to be unintentionally funny.
2018-07-31 21:25:30 Can’t understand venom. I’m going to need subtitles.
2018-07-31 21:25:52 Don't think it looks all that great.
2018-07-31 21:33:12 Not a comc book reader, Would Venom really make blades for fighting? This looks more like the protagonist of the Prototype game.
2018-07-31 21:33:36 Good lord, the franken-byting of the dialogue in that trailer is some of the worst I've ever seen.  It sounded like every single line was cobbled together from 5 or 6 different lines from different points in the movie.
2018-07-31 21:34:35 Does anyone else think Tom Hardy sounds like drunk Charlie from It’s always sunny?
2018-07-31 21:37:52 Anyone think when it shows two venom looks like anti venom
2018-07-31 21:38:19 I know it would never happen, but I wish this was R rated.
2018-07-31 21:40:15 This looks absolutely awful
2018-07-31 21:40:38 This looks like a hot mess.
2018-07-31 21:43:55 This actually looks great
2018-07-31 21:46:52 Some of this looks cool, but my God... the dialogue is fucking atrocious.  Looks like Tom Hardy is making some of it work, which is a credit to his ability, but I have a feeling this is going to be terrible.
2018-07-31 21:47:14 It really looks like Prototype: The movie
2018-07-31 21:47:50 I don't hate it...I don't love it either, but this trailer is tons better than the first. I'm not sure they know what they want it to be though. It's got this super dark vibe...and then 90's comic book venom. And I wouldn't say those mix...
2018-07-31 21:47:58 so that just laid out the entire plot
2018-07-31 21:48:25 I love Venom and I think Tom Hardy is great but man I an not optimistic for this movie.

I hope Im wrong
2018-07-31 21:49:51 I can't understand venom half the time
2018-07-31 21:53:26 This looks like shit.
2018-07-31 21:58:12 I want this to be so good, but I'm seeing a lot of red flags here...
2018-07-31 21:58:51 [Screenshot of Eddie/Venom in the doorway.](https://i.imgur.com/cbrWoly.jpg)
2018-07-31 22:05:43 Can super fans help me out here? 

The way I understand comic book venom is that Spiderman rejected the symbiote and it's next host was Eddie Brock, which combined created venom.

Venom isn't necessarily evil, but a vigilante that hunts city evil doers, but has a burning hatred for Spiderman, wants to kill Spiderman, and still has all of Spidermans powers which makes Spiderman's spideysense not work for venom.

Is this about right? 
2018-07-31 22:06:14 How do you do Venom without Spider-Man?
2018-07-31 22:11:18 Wow, the voice of Venom reminds me so much of The Darkness (the video game). I could just imagine Venom saying "Jackie.." instead.
2018-07-31 22:12:32 Few things:

This looks fucking AWESOME!

While I at least THOUGHT it was Tom Hardy (I haven't been following the movie at all), I now know it is. The same guy who was Bane, and who was also in the Revenant. This dude is one versatile motherfucker! Holy shit!

Lastly, is Venom like an alien version of Punisher or Ghost Rider? I get that he's not a "good guy," but it seemed he was only going after other clear bad guys. 
2018-07-31 22:12:47 This looks like microwaved garbage
2018-07-31 22:19:50 And then he fights a BIGGER venom!
2018-07-31 22:21:17 I generally don’t care much about Marvel, but I do like Venom. As a kid, I remember being so disturbed by him in Spider-Man 3. If somehow they put him into the MCU, I’d be so interested to see how that played out. One of his appeals, for me, is the very idea that he, being one of the most brutal and purely evil Marvel villains, is up against Spider-Man, probably the purest and most innocent hero. And now that Tom Holland is playing Spider-Man, and is portraying him as this virtuous and childish boy-hero, that would make it even more fascinating. That combo would make for some great storytelling and I’m so sad that it likely won’t happen.
2018-07-31 22:26:56 Please be good. *Please* be good.
2018-07-31 22:29:01 At [2:20](https://youtu.be/xLCn88bfW1o?t=140), is the guy on the right part cyborg or does his gloop suit just mold to his body better?
2018-07-31 22:48:47 Holy Fuck! 
2018-07-31 22:50:11 Sweet Jesus, they fixed the "sim-bye-ote" thing! And the tagline isn't awful! I'm happy now.
2018-07-31 22:56:36 Does this remind anyone of the game prototype?
2018-07-31 23:05:24 I'm still going to wait and see the reviews first, but this trailer has increased my interest a little.
2018-07-31 23:10:23 Why does Venom sound like a broken tv two rooms away playing a James Earl Jones interview?
2018-07-31 23:10:47 ouch that CGI looks...like venom barf
2018-07-31 23:11:03 I hope they’ll include that famous church bell scene
2018-07-31 23:17:15 "The world has enough superheroes"

Is much better than

"embrace your inner anti hero"

2018-07-31 23:20:00 I spy a little carnage!
2018-07-31 23:24:32 Special effects: fucking sweet.
Writing: fucking awful
2018-07-31 23:27:49 "The world has enough superheroes" , the world also has enough villains. 
2018-07-31 23:32:14 Topher Grace, eat your heart out!
2018-07-31 23:33:46 I'm still not totally sold on this but this is much better than the previous 2 trailers
2018-07-31 23:41:35 I'm not a fan of Venom's voice.  


I don't understand why they didn't use Mike Patton.  His voicework as The Darkness was so amazing.
2018-07-31 23:47:31 I'm hoping we get a red band trailer for this. 
2018-07-31 23:48:26 Damn, the way the symbiote puts itself over Tom Hardy is cool as fuck. 
2018-07-31 23:49:48 I can't wait to see it. I was a fan of the first trailer. 
2018-07-31 23:50:35 Oh I’m so excited. I just can’t hide it!
2018-07-31 23:51:04 I hope the final battle isn’t a CGI show
2018-07-31 23:51:57 Venom gonna eat your pancreas
2018-07-31 23:55:50 Anyone else notice that at 1:50 there’s a woman with what seem to be symbiote powers as well?? We know at the end of the trailer it looks like venom and riot fighting, but could there possibly be more symbiotes like scream??? 
2018-08-01 00:05:01 Is this a sequel for "Life" movie?
2018-08-01 00:12:29 The Spider-Man symbiote logo isn’t on venoms chest, so at least they got that part of the lore correct. Eddie Brock’s venoms powers (webbing) and looks (spider chest logo) stem from the symbiotes “memory” of being fused to Peter Parker.
2018-08-01 00:16:48 Everyone is talking about the shitty dialogue, and im just here thinking about how the evil ceo is the poor guy who gets killed by the psychopath in nightcrawler. He really went full circle
2018-08-01 00:19:22 It feels like this movie is based on a best selling tee shirt from hot topic. 
2018-08-01 00:29:15 Did they have to make Venom sound like the fucking Wishmaster?
2018-08-01 00:29:29 Nope.

Hopefully this kills the Sony license once and for all.
2018-08-01 00:30:28 I couldn’t understand a damn thing Venom said in the gas station.... Sony pls
2018-08-01 00:30:34 im eddie braph

the beginning dialogue is so heavily chopped together, my god
2018-08-01 00:31:20 There won't be much venom in this movie it only has a 50 million budget
2018-08-01 00:39:01 Finally, the most anticipated movie of 1994 is almost here!
2018-08-01 00:45:33 First of all I’m not really a fan of movies having multiple trailers. I find it annoying just cos it’s mainly stuff we’ve seen/heard from the first trailer. Anyway I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who had real difficulties understanding what Venom was saying. 


Venom actually looks fantastic in design. But the movie looks meh if I’m being totally honest. Oh well 
2018-08-01 00:59:00 Issa no from me.
2018-08-01 01:10:56 Better than first trailer.  I hope eddie is spends less time being afraid of the symbiote and more time being friends with it. It would be nice if he's a little not right on the head anyway
2018-08-01 01:11:57 All the dialogue in the beginning sounds like a bot produced it after learning every action trailer in the last 20 years.
2018-08-01 01:12:25 Better than the first trailer, though I still have criticisms. 

The Venom design is not one of them. 
2018-08-01 01:16:32 Look into my eyes. The way _I_ see it, _we_ can do whatever _we_ want.
2018-08-01 01:21:12 I love that Venom is always smiling. Super wholesome super hero. 
2018-08-01 01:24:06  Don’t know about anyone else, but I’m really excited for this movie, even if it won’t be in the MCU. The design is really cool
2018-08-01 01:24:26 What would these comments read like if it was “Marvel in Association With Sony instead?
2018-08-01 01:26:28 I really regret watching that trailer. It gives so much away.

They would have been so much better off not showing so much of the symbiote.

Once you see the monster, the audience stops being afraid. Build up the suspense so curiosity drives you to the theater. 
2018-08-01 01:37:44 What the hell is Eddie Brocks accent? He sounds like a 5 year old trying to play reporter. As Venom I understood like 50% of what he said... 0% of that bodega scene.
2018-08-01 01:44:55 We are... Groot!
2018-08-01 01:50:44 Can we collectively send dislikes to trailers that have the 5 second mini-trailer before the trailer? Makes me so irrationally angry.
2018-08-01 01:53:10 I really liked the cadence and rhythm of "weeee can do whatever weeeee want". I can see that being a memorable moment.
2018-08-01 02:15:50 IMO, Tom Hardy is one of the top 5 actors walking the planet right now. That being said, I’m still having trouble getting excited for this. 
2018-08-01 02:20:02 Can't wait to watch Venom!!
2018-08-01 02:20:58 Venom reminds me of The Darkness. (The game not the band) 
2018-08-01 02:23:15 This looks awesome
2018-08-01 02:25:55 Oh so that’s what Tom Hardy looks like. Always wondered. 
2018-08-01 02:29:44 Bring back Topher Grace! 














Or not.....
2018-08-01 02:35:27 It's no Bane
2018-08-01 02:39:36 I don't care what people are saying. This movie had me interested when I heard Tom Hardy was the main. This looks like it could be a lot of fun. Really hope they go with R for the rating. 
2018-08-01 02:52:17 There is a lot of hate over this trailer and I have to state overall I think they made Venom perfectly as far as the character design goes.  It's very hard to vision a 2d character in 3d and pull it off. To me the CGI Venom looks exactly like I have always wanted to see. A big bulky creepy snake like Tod McFarlin character come to life. The previous version of him was just to small.   

My big nit pic with the new Jurassic World movies was the Indo rex/raptor had "summer" alligator teeth vs. sharp in a row teeth like the raptor. Seeing Venoms teeth all in a line vs going every direction makes me happy. 
2018-08-01 02:53:24 Dialogue is god awful but holy shit the Venom CGI and voice are absolutely perfect. Such a shame it looks like its going to be wasted
2018-08-01 02:57:49 Oof. Turd in the wind indeed. 
2018-08-01 03:07:39 Don’t know how I feel about Venom’s voice but this trailer was much better than the first. They scored so many points with me just by pronouncing symbiote correctly. Thinking about the sym-BI-ote pronunciation makes me irate. 
2018-08-01 03:09:16 Im actually pretty excited about this, i feel like they will do a really cool iteration of Venom. 
2018-08-01 03:27:13 It’s so hard to understand what he’s saying ;/
2018-08-01 04:00:22 "Eyes, lungs... Bank lease... So many slacks, so little time."

What-the-actual-fuck is he saying?
2018-08-01 04:56:42 they latched on to the we are venom thing lol
2018-08-01 05:05:08 This movie will be hot garbage.


Or, maybe the movie will have something good, but the Villain is hot garbage.
2018-08-01 05:13:49 “We will eat both of your arms, and then both of your legs, and then we will eat your face right off of your head, You will be this armless, legless, faceless thing. Rolling down the street. Like a turd. In the wind.”

lmao. that was amusing. I like how they're making venom into a bit of a dok
2018-08-01 06:24:58 This trailer left me confused. Is this movie supposed to be comedy a horror or a super hero movie? I'm not really sure. 

It doesn't look good to me.
2018-08-01 06:35:16 The “We are Venom” looked corny as fuck.
2018-08-01 10:02:44 This movie feels like it was made in 1998
2018-08-01 10:23:49 Holy shit, I've rewatched the first 30 seconds over and over and laughing my ass off. It's hilariously bad!
2018-08-01 10:42:11 I dunno. I think this movie is going to be really bad. 
2018-08-01 10:45:59 Sony i hope this is it. I like that you want to explore this side of venom. No matter how this movie does its time to let disney take over. 
2018-08-01 12:09:51 I have never read any Venom comics, is this typical dialogue for them? "Headless armless faceless shit rolling in the wind"? I want to like this movie but the dialogue is putting me off big time.
2018-08-01 13:44:15 5-second TV Spot spoilers are the cancer of trailers.
2018-08-01 13:45:29 I think this movie is going to bomb hard. I don't understand though, Tom Hardy is a great actor but from the trailers he doesn't look promising. 
2018-08-01 18:35:22 Guess I'm in the minority, that looked bad ass and I've been excited for this since it was announced. 
2018-08-01 21:10:02 Jesus what was up with the CGI in some of those parts ? I almost felt like I was watching Mortal Kombat Annihilation 
2018-08-01 23:08:59 On one hand, Venom looks like he was taken straight out of the comics and a lot of the visual effects are incredibly creative and expressive. On the other hand, the dialogue... oof.
2018-08-02 06:22:46 They really hit home the #2 in the title. 
2018-08-02 07:31:45 This movie is, let's be real here, probably not gonna be very good and it sucks that it (so far at least) has no connection to the greater MCU but my god they got Venom exactly right. He's a hulking terrifying alien monster and seeing him on screen is amazing.
2018-08-07 07:34:03 4 time Oscar-nominee Michelle Williams runs twice in this trailer, and says one "concerned girlfriend" line. 

Interesting.
2018-08-10 02:00:20 This movie looks awful.
2018-08-10 07:19:19 Did I just watch the whole movie?
2018-08-25 23:29:12 The end battle looks like an early 200s superhero movie with a bad guy who is basically an evil version of the good guy fighting the superhero, and I think these movies have evolved past that and therefore I hope this movie is more than that.
2018-09-16 20:47:21 Venom is going to be amazing
2018-07-31 17:32:34 Is this what this sub has turned into? People who can't actually think of criticisms so they make fun of accents and people who for some reason can't hear? 
2018-07-31 17:16:29 I'm fucking loving Venom in these. I was worried we wouldn't have enough of him but have way more Eddie instead
2018-07-31 17:28:46 My flop sense is tingling!
2018-07-31 17:29:37 Riz Ahmed's bad guy is generic AF! That 'take mankind to a higher life-form' dialogue has been used more times than Tom Cruise's special height-amplifying stool.  
   
Venom also looks too cartoonish, the CGI is too shiny and frankly bad. Seems this movie will be as bad as expected then.
2018-07-31 17:32:35 Ugh that final scene in the trailer is the end of the movie isn't it? Goddammit Sony.
2018-07-31 17:38:07 The shop scene looked absolutely shit, can't say I have high hopes for this one
2018-07-31 19:44:09 I guess I'm one of the few people that really like what Tom Hardy is doing? Like as both Brock and Venom? His voice is pretty spot on to how I always imagined it being.
2018-07-31 17:22:16 Seems like it's literally any other modern superhero movie so meh
2018-07-31 17:58:27 Oh no...
2018-07-31 18:00:13 looks pretty bad
2018-07-31 18:04:04 To me it looks great so I can’t wait for the movie, October can’t get here fast enough. However, the CGI does need some polish but this is just a trailer so there’s plenty of time to perfect it until the movie comes out. #WeAreVenom
2018-07-31 18:55:50 God Venom himself looks horrifyingly good. 
2018-07-31 19:41:09 Has no one read the comics?? I'm super excited for this!!! He talks just like the comic book. 
2018-07-31 21:33:43 ITT: Watching two symbiotes fight is awful. Tom Hardy's voice, awful. Venom's joke, awful.

Feels like absolutely nothing makes people happy. I say FUCK YEAH! Love Tom Hardy and I love Venom.

It's a win win! 
2018-07-31 23:58:44 I can’t believe this is the same community that broke their arms jacking off to Black Panther (which was a decent Marvel movie, that’s it) but has to take a shit on something that looks pretty awesome because Tom Hardy isn’t enunciating his lines in true Brooklyn accent to a high enough standard. 
2018-08-01 13:26:15 Seriously, fuckasses, stop making intros for trailers! 

I KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I AM WATCHING!

YOU GODDAMN PIECE OF FUCK SHIT STICK GODDAMN BRAINDEAD SHITASS!"!

I'm talking to you, Sony Pictures, you cocksucking goat-rapists!!
2018-07-31 17:23:35 A train wreck where you just can't look away. 
2018-07-31 17:46:10 English is only a second language for me and I understood everything Venom said. Then again, I also (mostly) understood Mads Mikkelsen in Hannibal but I'm still surprised so many complain about the speech being garbled or whatever? 

And the movie looks positively badass. Venom, man!
2018-07-31 17:55:29 No spider symbol... Not even web slinging. Venom has web slinging man come on
2018-07-31 18:08:09 I’m kinda surprised by the reaction, I think this looks fun enough. 

I already knew from the first trailer that this would be far from great. 
2018-07-31 18:17:21 More like Prototype the movie geez, also that CGI looks fucking spastic, sorry.
2018-07-31 18:19:55 "Like a turd in the wind."

Dammit, Sony, you almost had me sold.
2018-07-31 18:26:30 That looks so fucking bad.

Even the end where he's like "oh I have a parasite"

You do a venom movie and you don't even call it a symbiote?

For Ruben Fleischer I expected more. This is the zombieland guy! You're better than this!
2018-07-31 19:19:55 The more I see, the more I realize that I will be watching this when it finally comes out on Netflix.
2018-07-31 20:53:30 Yep, that's Venom using the word "turd."

Illegal streaming it is, then.
2018-07-31 21:44:28 He sounds exactly like the Venom from the 90s cartoon. It's awesome.
2018-07-31 22:45:13 ITT: People automatically not giving this movie a chance because Sony made it and it's not MCU
2018-07-31 22:49:42 Inb4 awesome movie, terrible trailer editing.
2018-07-31 23:08:05 Seriously is everyone just going to bitch about this movie? 
2018-08-01 01:36:55 I think it's gonna be great. 

Addressing some common complaints here: 

"I can't understand a word Venom is saying" maybe there's a problem with whatever you're listening to the trailer audio on, because I heard - and understood - it fine on my phone speakers, Bluetooth headphones, crappy sharper image Bluetooth speaker, TV speakers, and Laptop speakers. It sounds inhuman, abyssal, and unsettling. Just like I always expected Venom to sound.

"Eddie talks like a baby!" Eddie Brock isn't usually portrayed as being particularly smart, but he's also often portrayed as an alcoholic. That could explain the slurred speech as well. Then there's the fact that there are a shit load of people who actually speak like that. Never been to NY so I can't say how accurate the accent is, but I have to face it Everytime I go to PA or NJ. The accent isn't "bad", and as long as it is consistent (something most European actors struggle with in American accents) it's not a problem.

"The comedy ruins the dark tone!" I'm going with the exception that most people haven't read a lot of Venom. He's usually really cheesy, even when the tone does not call for that humor. It's pretty jarring in the comics, but that's the character. They're playing it through. As for the "Turd in the wind" comment, my initial impression is that this is when the symbiote and Eddie have a closer bond. It isn't the symbiote doing his own thing, it's them both as Venom.

"Movies where the Protagonist faces Antagonist with the same abilities suck!" Iron Man, Iron Man II, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Captain America II, Ant Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange...and that's JUST the ever-loved Marvel movies. Not counting anything outside of the greater Marvel family.

I'm gonna watch it. I'm probably going to love it. That's all that matters to me.
2018-08-01 03:23:23 I can't believe venom said "like a turd in the wind"... who writes this stuff?
2018-08-01 14:55:36 Im trying to work on my cynicism, but this is such an obvious fail from the outset i cant help it. Once again Sony is going all-in on a flawed idea. Marvel Studios are witholding their involvement to see if critical reaction would damage their brand.
2018-07-31 17:23:17 Woody Harrelson said he was playing Carnage and that it was an after credits scene in this movie.  Now we see a guy that looks identical Cletus Kasady and a Carnage like creature in the new trailer.  Did something change?  Were there reshoots?  A lot of this CGI seems like its been badly rushed. 
2018-07-31 17:26:44 That trailer was a bit of a mess
2018-07-31 17:32:17 Visually the Symbiote look good. Especially that last shot with Venom against Riot. But everything else feels bland. The dialogue seems uninteresting and cliche. 
2018-07-31 19:18:19 I hope that I’m wrong, but this has “worst movie of the year” written all over it.
2018-07-31 21:22:17 I have a parasite 🤣😂🤣😱 !
2018-07-31 17:26:38 Hey, it's pretty great we are getting a Venom film. Didn't know if we would ever see that.
2018-07-31 17:28:35 This seems like it's so bad, it's good kinda of movie. Especially that last scene. Someone actually wrote that.
2018-07-31 18:37:07 Great, a final battle where the main antagonist has the same design and powers as the protagonist. It's happened in Superman, Hulk, Black Panther, Ant Man. Hated all those movies because of it. It's such a lazy and uninteresting conclusion to movies. The only time it's ever worked was Mechagodzilla.
2018-07-31 17:05:06 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:46:12 I see a lot of people criticizing Hardy's style of speaking, but am I the only one who thinks he's intentionally trying to paint Eddie Brock as a bumbling, blunt idiot? The way he portrays the character to the point of comical exaggeration and how unrefined his lines are convey that to me. 
2018-07-31 17:51:26 I feel like I have seen the entire movie
2018-07-31 18:00:28 This looks like a terrible Venom movie but a fantastic Ghost Rider one.
2018-07-31 18:00:48 This looks "Catwoman" bad
2018-07-31 18:19:37 Well shit I liked it
2018-07-31 18:23:27 This looks so, so, so, so dumb. I know Michelle Williams said she took this basically for the money, but lord girl, how broke were you that this seemed like a good idea??
2018-07-31 18:23:53 Okok. I see everyone is super skeptical of this movie. And parts of the trailer are a bit weird. But lets be real here. They NAILED Venom's aesthetic. He looks BADASS. I hope this movie does well and eventually leads into a Spidey Vs Venom movie that doesn't involve Eric Foreman.
2018-07-31 18:24:53 This looks like crap but it has zero competition for several weeks when it releases. It's gonna make $$$ and we're gonna get sequels.....*sigh* 
2018-07-31 18:26:59 I thought Carnage was gonna be in this movie...so it’s just another bigger version of venom going against venom?
2018-07-31 18:27:00 What in the flying fuck is up with his voice, yet again? Does he go out of his ways to get roles where he tries to one up himself in trying to make himself even less understandable every movie? 
2018-07-31 18:31:08 i'm slightly confused, I thought Venom was a villain and the tag "the world has enough superheroes" reinforces that, but looks like a good guy here
2018-07-31 18:32:27 What is with this new trend of showing a clip before the trailer starts of what's in the trailer?
2018-07-31 18:33:46 The highlight of the film is supposed to be the terror you feel from “Venom.” However, it’s hard to feel any terror when the CGI is worse than young Jabba.
2018-07-31 18:35:39 Is it just me or does some CGI look really bad/cheesy?
2018-07-31 18:36:40 "like a turd rolling down the street" 

So...like this movie?
2018-07-31 19:03:28 The cgi looks fucking great. Everything else not so much 
2018-07-31 19:22:20 This film is gonna be a disaster, 48% RT score coming in hot 
2018-07-31 19:28:01 Its gonna be a flop. You cant have this venom without spiderman, also venom gets most of not all his abilities from being on spiderman in the first place. The people making this movie are just ignoring source material.
2018-07-31 20:03:04 First off, why does Eddie talk so....weird? And secondly how can they have a Venom movie with zero mention of Spider-Man? I mean I know why legally but storywise..how?
2018-07-31 20:10:37 ITT:  r/movies being fantastically pretentious as usual.

I'm going into this movie with no expectations, and I know I'm going to be happy.

C'mon guys, it's a "superhero" movie.  Not Gone With The Wind.
2018-07-31 21:25:29 I'm really shocked at all this negativity! :( I absolutely LOVED the trailer! I mean it has other symbiotes, they fixed the complaining about the pronunciation, the action and movement is fast and amazing, Venom looks GREAT in my opinion, and the voice is creepy and the whole thing is violent and dark, and Venom even has his twisted sense of humor and head biting thing from the comics!

WHY is everyone being so pissy about it here? It's like they all saw a totally different trailer... :( :( I'm actually extremely hyped for this!
2018-07-31 21:29:21 Guess I’m the only one hyped for Venom 🤷‍♂️
2018-07-31 21:30:48 They did a MUCH better job with this trailer NOW I’m hyped.
2018-07-31 21:33:47 Awesome awesome awesome
2018-07-31 21:34:46 This trailer doesn't suck. 
2018-07-31 21:35:12 Riot is the main antagonist but that scene with the redneck looking guy being "fed" to the symbiote in the lab really has never thinking Carnage is going to show up.
2018-07-31 21:35:26 Y'all are too f***ing over critical. I had no issue understanding either character and I don't see any issue with the humor in the convience store. This is coming from someone who was let down by trailer #1.

Color me hyped now.
2018-07-31 21:43:09 All aboard the fucking hype train!!
2018-07-31 22:20:33 Fit it into the MCU and we gucci
2018-07-31 22:37:51 I’m genuinely excited about this movie! Anyone know what it’s going to be rated tho? 
2018-07-31 23:29:39 Does every fucking trailer need the spoiler in the beginning that shows the coolest shot from the fucking trailer?!?!?! 
2018-08-01 00:40:04 The internet has clearly already decided to hate this movie based on 1) the first trailer and 2) it's not in the MCU and 3) the internet hates Sony (except for Playstation).

That said, this trailer completely reassures me after the first one.  The first trailer was not a good first impression, but this looks like they are really trying to do Venom as properly as they can under the circumstances.

I am a huge Spider-Man geek, and I immediately lit up when Venom says the line "Eyes... Lungs... Pancreas...." etc.  It's straight from the comic, and is exactly the Venom I was hoping for - the guy that eats people.  There are so many ways to water down Venom for casual audiences, but it looks like they are trying to expose everyone to Venom as he was created in the 90s.

Most of the criticism in this thread is:  "Hardy has a weird voice", "I wish this was in the MCU", and "It's still a super-hero style movie with all the predictable tropes that come with it."

I understand and can agree with the complaints.  Clean-cut rich badguys with high tech labs and sanctimonious monologues about how the world needs (insert macguffin).  Lex Luthor in the DCU, Iron Monger (Iron Man 1), Ant-Man's villain, Big Hero 6's villain, Norman Osbourne, the villains in Iron Fist on Netflix, and so on and so on.  It HAS been done to death.

That said, with Venom there are really only 2 origin options that fans will accept:  High Tech Lab (Ultimate Spider-Man origin) or Alien From Space (Animated 90s series origin).  They have their hands tied by the source material, and if they were allowed to be in the MCU with it, I am sure it would be the Alien origin instead.  

I have my fingers crossed for this, but I already know it will bomb at the box office because the internet has rejected it for the reasons above.  It could still be the best Venom movie we ever get in my lifetime though.
2018-08-01 07:08:37 I can’t stop cringing 
2018-07-31 18:43:08 holy fuck the comments,

GRAPHICS ARE BAD

THX FOR GIBBING HOLE MOVIE SONY >:((((

HIS ENEMY IS EVIL VENOM??? SMH

Like for fucks sake, I think the movie looks great but everyone is just coming up with reasons to not like this movie. 
2018-07-31 22:45:39 I've never seen a trailer look this bad. Holy shit this movie is going to be a turd and a half. 
2018-07-31 17:27:56 I'm really looking forward to this. Could nit-pick all day long but I won't because I feel I've been waiting to see live action Venom film ever since I got introduced to his character in my favorite Alien Costume Saga episodes of TAS. After it was such a hassle with Spider-Man 3 where Raimi didn't even want Venom, I'm happy this character is getting his own movie and will be (re)introduced to general audience.

EDIT: Spelling.
2018-07-31 17:28:31 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:28:34 It's definitely the best trailer so far. I just hope the movie is better as I really am lacking the excitement I should have. If 12 year old me knew I wasn't stoked for a Venom movie he'd be very disappointed in me.

I hope it has a link to the spiderverse and with that the mcu, if not it kind of feels like a waste to have this character so separate.
2018-07-31 17:32:08 looks like its going to be fun to watch because of how bad it is. just seems soo cheesy
2018-07-31 17:32:47 Meh.
2018-07-31 17:34:07 This looks like a fake trailer they’d put before Tropic Thunder. Tom Hardy’s “New Yorker” accent in San Francisco sounds like an extra playing a taxi driver. 

Also yes, the film is not in the MCU. The “in association with Marvel” logo was the biggest insult the studio could have done to this movie. 

Hard, hard pass. 
2018-07-31 17:34:17 I see a lot of people saying they can't understand him... I didn't have that issue at all.

I doubt this will be better than "okay" but I'm still somewhat excited for it. The special effects still need work though, some of that stuff looked really bad.
2018-07-31 17:50:22 I guess the plot twist is a 30 year old toddler.
2018-07-31 18:09:28 I thought we're over "the villain has the same skillset as the protagonist" cliche in superhero movies. Guess not.
2018-07-31 18:14:31 I remember the crazy  hype Tom Hardy's Bane created.
This feels the exact opposite of it.
2018-07-31 18:16:21 This isn’t going to end well. 

Writing seems HORRIBLY stilted. And really poorly delivered by Hardy. Idk what that voice/accent is but it’s not good. 

The baddie he’s fighting is...another black symbiote host. He’s also using arm blades, so if Carnage ever comes about, there goes his uniqueness. 

The “jokes” at the end didn’t land for me. At all. 

I’ll be shocked if this movie doesn’t get panned. 
2018-07-31 23:36:22 JESUS, the hype is insane with this one boys. I've been waiting my whole life for Sony to ruin my favorite antihero! Looks like they won't dissapoint. 
2018-08-01 02:24:36 The amount of hate in this sub for any non mcu superhero movie is crazy
2018-08-01 11:20:59 Hope they clean up the CGI. Venom looks like total trash, which is a problem considering Venom is the main attraction.
2018-08-02 03:47:26 Dear God this is going to be terrible.
2018-07-31 17:51:26 lol that fake ass CGI Venom scenes. Who watches this garbage?
2018-07-31 17:19:40 Well no more criticism about not being able to see Venom's face enough.
2018-07-31 17:24:42 Is that enemy symbiote supposed to be Anti-Venom or Carnage? 

edit: guys it might be Riot, idk 



though that's fairly disappointing
2018-07-31 17:27:55 This looks bonkers as fuck. I love they're fully embracing the hokey villainy of the character. 
2018-07-31 17:27:55 Holy shit Venom is a complete beast! The action scenes between symbiotes are the only thing I'm looking forward too. 
2018-07-31 17:31:47 OK Guys, really have to be honest here. If the 1st trailer had me on the fence but this one...this one really sold it for me.

Really looking forward to seeing it.
2018-07-31 17:37:36 Clearly from the studio that brought you The Amazing Spider-man and The Amazing Spider-man 2. 
2018-07-31 22:41:06 Seriously I cannot be the only one that thinks this looks absolutely terrible?! The CGI, cringy dialogue. This has all the marks of Sony ruining yet another property. I was just about getting over the reality of a Venom origin without Spidey but watching this is gutting. 
2018-07-31 17:27:23 Fuck it. I'm in. Lets do this!

Hype train started! w00t w00t!!!

(also, too many people being overly critical, just shut yer face and enjoy the ride)
2018-07-31 17:30:01 What happened to “Locke” Tom Hardy? I could listen to his voice for hours, this sounds like a completely different man
2018-07-31 17:36:40 I'm still having trouble with symbi-oat, but I really do like the design for Venom. The inability to understand the symbi-oat or Tom Hardy is pretty annoying though. Also, I'm not digging hearing Venom talk about what he's going to eat. It wasn't very good in the comics and here it doesn't do anything other than make a terrifying monster seem like an edgey cringefest.
2018-07-31 17:37:51 Wou wave wy wermission wo wie watwan
2018-07-31 17:38:51 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:41:51 The real question is , Is this gonna be Rated R ?
2018-07-31 17:51:45 It's interesting how many of the same shots from the first trailer appear in the second trailer, but now they have special effects. Shots like the two black SUV's crashing and the computers being swept off the desks were in trailer #1 but had no sign of Venom. I remember wondering if Venom was going to have telekinetic abilities because of that.
2018-07-31 17:54:40 CGI looking a little rough there, hope its just early because its a trailer.
2018-07-31 17:59:25 I still don't know what I think of this movie.
2018-07-31 17:59:38 So that’s what Venom is going to look like since it hasn’t seen Spidey yet. Not sure I’m okay with it. Actually? I’m not. 
2018-07-31 18:02:46 Tom definitely sounds like Christopher Walken, or is it just me?
2018-07-31 18:03:02 I really like the Venom design but Hardy voice as Eddie is weird, I have no idea what Venom is saying half the time and some of the dialogue is just awful
2018-07-31 18:05:55 Kinda hard to understand what Venom is saying imo. Wish it was more like CW Zoom. 

Excited that well at least get to see a decent amount of Venom at least
2018-07-31 18:06:40 The end was pretty funny.  But I'm still skeptical. 
2018-07-31 18:06:43 God damn trills everywhere
2018-07-31 18:08:44 Honestly I’ll throw my money on this regardless how it feels just to support the idea of venom on screen. I just wish they fixed his eyes and made them closer to the comics and fixed that accent for both venom and Tom hardy. 
2018-07-31 18:08:57 So was the guy with the long red hair in the beginning suppose to be Cletus Kasady?
2018-07-31 18:09:27 He sounds like Bane.
2018-07-31 18:10:04 I just know this is going to be a movie where one of my main criticisms is "They didn't use Venom enough." The symbiote's edgelord-style reveling in its might and intimidation, and power over Eddie is entertaining as hell, and the SFX are neat.

Or maybe that's just relative to everything else looking weak.
2018-07-31 18:10:19 I honestly feel like there is so much secrecy surrounding this movie that there are potential massive differences from what we've seen in the marketing and the movie itself. I'm hoping at least.
2018-07-31 18:11:19 So, unlike some here, I can understand what Venom says. But how can anyone understand what Tom Hardys saying? What does Tom say at the end? "OH! I have a p_____________. Ya.. Night Mrs. Chan." 'Power of Satan' is what I hear but that doesn't make sense.
2018-07-31 18:11:28 hey, i was sold on this the moment it got announced. im not a hard man to please .
2018-07-31 18:11:50 The whole thing reminds me of Guyver The Bioboosted Armor.
2018-07-31 18:12:22 Tom Hardy's voice sounds kinda like [Anton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4EhqjtAQU8) from in living color. 
2018-07-31 18:17:11 I'll probably rent this when it comes out on VOD, but until then I'll probably hang back.
2018-07-31 18:18:15 Of all the problems with this trailer, everyone is pointing to Hardy’s voice, which I feel he did a good job with.
2018-07-31 18:19:52 Is no one going to comment on how obvious it is that the symbiote will only fully cover Eddie Brock for a scene or two at the climax of the film?

Almost all the shots of the full suit took place on similar-looking city streets (likely some kind of chase with a bunch of car explosions and getting thrown into buildings) then one scene in a convenience store, which he'll probably stop at in the first act, then get thrown into during that same chase scene, have his exchange with his friend, then go back to business.

Watching this trailer feels like listening to a guy tell you how he'll rip you off before he does it. 
2018-07-31 18:19:59 No Spidey, no interest. Sorry Sony, let me know when you're ready to take this seriously.
2018-07-31 18:20:23 Growing up on the FOX KIDS Spider-Man, I have always loved venom as a villain. I do appreciate that they got the look down, and I’m super happy it’s a deeper toned voice.  There’s a few bad looking/ sounding versions of the character (Spider-Man 3....), this doesn’t seem like one of those.

Now if they pull off a decent movie, I’ll be really impressed.
2018-07-31 18:20:35 I'm only watching this for Hardy
2018-07-31 18:20:45 Tom Hardy sounds like Johnny from The Room. I don't care how good the movie may be, that accent and his style of emoting throughout the trailer made me feel like I was watching the Star Wars Prequels again. Yeesh.
2018-07-31 18:22:17 That accent is.......awful
2018-07-31 18:22:30 Why are there two scenes of Venom threatening to eat people’s various body parts? Is it like his thing in the comics? His signature threat?
2018-07-31 18:22:56 "Like a turd in the wind."

Had me up until that.
2018-07-31 18:23:23 He looks a lot better than he did in Spider-Man 3! There’s hope!
2018-07-31 18:24:49 I like how in the first trailer all those monitors just exploded by themselves. But now we know its because of some bad cgi goofball. 
2018-07-31 18:24:59 So they're making him what.. a "bad but good" superhero?

I can see multiple Symbiote people - (Big Boss fight spoiled in the trailer itself sigh), who Venom is clearly going to dispatch whilst also out-running the cops who assume he is a bad guy. Sounds flaky but I'll give it a shot.

Who wants to bet me a months gold that the post credit scene shows the Factory destroyed and on fire, and it pans down to some red symbiote goo that wasn't destroyed by Venom sliding down a drain or something? Setting up Carnage for the pumping out of crappy movies that are bound to follow this.
2018-07-31 18:25:41 I know it seems to be a running joke with not understanding Venom or Tom Hardy, but I understood them just fine. I am still unsure about this movie though. 
2018-07-31 18:25:59 Goddamn it, he went from having an 803 Ducati Scrambler in the first trailer to the 1100 in this one! 
2018-07-31 18:26:29 Does anyone know if carnage is supposed to make an appearance? 
2018-07-31 18:26:33 IDK man. 
2018-07-31 18:26:34 I hope we get a cameo of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield having coffee together or something
2018-07-31 18:26:55 Prototype: the Movie looks like it's gonna be sweet!
2018-07-31 18:27:02 Tom Hardy being difficult to understand as usual.
2018-07-31 18:27:58 couldnt really understand what venom was saying, the voice effect is kinda weird.
2018-07-31 18:28:10 Slight improvement, the CGI looks a little better overall although there are still some glaringly bad parts like when the little venom sperm is coming out of his shoulder and talking to him.

Probably going to give this a miss in the cinemas tbh.
2018-07-31 18:29:40 Am I the only one who has had zero problems understanding Hardy in any of his roles?

2018-07-31 18:29:45 Jesus, that dialogue editing at the start. "I always seem to find myself... <QUESTIONING>...something the government might not be looking at..."
2018-07-31 18:29:52 Couldn't they just ask Hardy to do the voiceover at the beggining of the trailer?

I could cut those lines together better. Sounds like a film school project.
2018-07-31 18:30:19 The dialogue may be cringey, but the facial expressions sell the glee Venom is having in threatening those guys so perfectly.
2018-07-31 18:31:44 Tom Hardy and funny voices, name a more iconic duo
2018-07-31 18:32:46 The narration sounded like a shitty Christopher Walken impression.
2018-07-31 18:33:21 Reminds me of Prototype more than anything.
2018-07-31 18:33:27 Can't understand half the dialogue. Hope it improves before release.
2018-07-31 18:34:38 This kind of feels similar in idea to the Hulk except less tragic sad story and more horror/thriller. They're both about guys that seem to have inner conflicts that are represented physically through their struggle with their super-human powers. 
2018-07-31 18:35:40 I actually really like Tom Hardy's accent. If feels real accurate people I've met who speak the same way
2018-07-31 18:35:52 I didnt realize Venom ate people...
2018-07-31 18:36:56 First Bane now Venom...Hardy seems to be cursed with the "difficult-to-understand voice" characters.

Aside from that, this second trailer doens't give much indication that we're getting a good film...expecting mediocre at best.
2018-07-31 18:38:06 I love that description "One of Marvels most enigmatic, complex and badass characters" r/iamverybadass 
2018-07-31 18:38:28 It too time for people to warm up to the Joker and Bane as well.


2018-07-31 18:38:28 I hope some how, some way that Spiderman is part of this origin story.
2018-07-31 18:38:45 I want so bad for this to be good. I'm not very hopeful.
2018-07-31 18:39:25 I dont know
2018-07-31 18:39:55 Favourite "villan" ever, been waiting for another movie with Venom since I learned Venom existed
2018-07-31 18:39:58 The marketing for this movie has me so all over the place, after the first teaser with no actual Venom footage I was sceptical, then after the first full trailer I was in with the whole "we are Venom" line at the end. Now I'm kind of half in and half out, the dialog and CGI seem pretty meh, but Tom Hardy and Venom himself look cool.
2018-07-31 18:40:28 Anyone else wish it was carnage instead? 
2018-07-31 18:42:00 He sounds like prison mike
2018-07-31 18:42:15 “Venom, you’re into this. Your black. You sound black.”
2018-07-31 18:42:18 “See that’s where the trouble began. That smile...

That damned smile”.
2018-07-31 18:42:24 Any idea if this is going to be R or PG-13?
2018-07-31 18:42:35 >that last line

/r/iamverybadass
2018-07-31 18:43:00 why did I get a notification for this weird shit
2018-07-31 18:43:16 Is he supposed to be Christopher Walken?
2018-07-31 18:43:45 Audiomachine always makes a trailer better 
2018-07-31 18:43:49 Funny how Venom kind of sounds like Bane
2018-07-31 18:44:52 Such a shame we will not see Venom in the MCU anytime soon.  
2018-07-31 18:44:53 You’re trash brock
2018-07-31 18:44:54 So is he both the antagonist and the protagonist here?
2018-07-31 18:45:36 Didnt he die
2018-07-31 18:45:36 So is this marvel adjacent since they said the MCU peter Parker will show up in it?
2018-07-31 18:46:02 Oh shit!
2018-07-31 18:46:21 I feel like I'm the only one here who understood both of them perfectly the whole time.
2018-07-31 18:46:38 It sounds like a trailer for a movie version of The Darkness.
2018-07-31 18:46:50 Venom sounds like Javier Bardem as Capitan Salazar
2018-07-31 18:47:23 Well that looks a lot less like shit than the first trailer.
2018-07-31 18:48:13 So is this carnage in the film or is it still Riot? I swear I see some deep [red tones](https://i.imgur.com/sAfi8vW.jpg) in the suit. This is around the 2:19 mark. 
2018-07-31 18:49:03 did they really spoil the last fight of the movie?
2018-07-31 18:49:05 So it’s a shitty version of Upgrade that cost way more to make.
2018-07-31 18:49:17 Idk man, i'm getting x-men origins vibes from this... I hope they turn it into some kind of heist movie but that's probably not the case. 
2018-07-31 18:49:28 Is that supposed to be Carnage at the end? Riz Ahmed’s character is bonded to it but it looks kinda dark grey or something, not red at all. Maybe they’re using another symbiote like Scream, Mayhem, Riot etc?
2018-07-31 18:49:48 I mean, it's better than the first trailer, but this still looks just awful. I really don't see what they're going for here. This is peak superhero oversaturation.
2018-07-31 18:49:49 Why are trailers always half as loud as other videos no matter your volume level? 


2018-07-31 18:49:56 The cgi looks really bad. But I’m still kind of interested.
2018-07-31 18:50:00 "Like a Turd in the wind"

100% won me over to watch this movie 
2018-07-31 18:50:17 Why's Hollywood so fixated with giving Tom Hardy barely intelligible voice alterations 
2018-07-31 18:50:19 I'm going to have to ask the manager to turn on closed captioning in the theater for this one. 
2018-07-31 18:50:25 I'm......optimistic about this actually. Initially I was pretty skeptical with it not being tied into the MCU. That being said:

* They nailed the look of venom. Like seriously he looks sick. 
* The animations and use of the symbiote powers seem very fluid and cool.
* The CGI although heavily done, doesn't look out of place. It looks like it was meant to be there.
* Venoms personality is on point with the original comic version. Literally a twisted mentally unstable version of Peter Parker/Spiderman. I know people are hating on the jokes, but THAT IS Venom.
* The story, albeit the little the information we have, seems interesting. It's believeable that a government contractor or company discovered that symbiote and are doing tests on it to improve the human race.

That being said. I have some concerns.

 * How will venom function in a universe with no heroes, and no Spidey? I get that his backstory now is he stumbled upon a secret lab and venom attached to him, so now he's attempting to take down said company. But still that seems like a shallow plot line for any follow ups planned.
* Why does the company want to "evolve" the human race. It would make more sense if the company was doing it for some form of a super soldier program akin to Captain America, the Hulk, etc. But just the "evolve" plotline seems shallow.
* In general I'm afraid that this IP and movie will rest almost entirely on the writers and director. Whether or not it can stand on its own with no marvel IP involved, will depend on them. It can be done, look at Deadpool(I realize there's some x men and cable, but those were unused IP for the most part).
2018-07-31 18:50:44 This dialogue is so... clunky.
2018-07-31 18:50:47 I love that Venom is huge. I'm a big fan of the scorpion era venom where he was a big hulking monster instead of spider-man with teeth.
2018-07-31 18:50:49 I'm having to rewind way too many times just to understand what he's saying and most of it isn't even with the Venom diaogue.
2018-07-31 18:50:55 Sony: We made a Venom movie! Give us a chance!  
Me: What about the San Raimi movies? Did you give them a chance? 
2018-07-31 18:50:59 Anyone know who the voice of Venom is? I can't find it, sounds like Lance Reddick but I doubt it is.
2018-07-31 18:51:09 Well they cast the right dude for Cletus Kasady. He looks just like comic book version, inbred as all get out.
2018-07-31 18:51:13 Does comic book Venom really just threaten to eat people all the time? Maybe it would work if "turd in the wind" guy looked terrified, but he's just, like, confused. 
2018-07-31 18:51:20 My brain is having difficulty understating how Tom Hardy can be both the perfect casting for Eddy Brock/Venom and the worst at the same time.
2018-07-31 18:51:25 Why is Tom Hardy doing his best Christopher Walken impression?
2018-07-31 18:51:31 I think this trailer makes it look way better than last time.
2018-07-31 18:51:49 The line with the turd made me cringe! Also the "normal American guy" voice was weird! 

He's amazing when a weird voice fits the part, but with this... Nahh not feeling it!   
2018-07-31 18:52:12 I’m pretty stoked
2018-07-31 18:52:17 Well this is... *better.*

The CG doesn’t look fantastic and that last line about... being a turd in the wind is... *fuck.* But this sells the movie and Venom better than the first trailer at least.
2018-07-31 18:53:11 Much better than the first but still really not very good. Can hardly understand what he's saying, still not sure what the actual plot is going to really be about. It's very hard to pull off a movie about an Anti-Hero without any heroes in it imo, I hope they prove us wrong though
2018-07-31 18:53:30 The Dialogue during the first 15-20 seconds was pretty bad, but the rest of the trailer looked really good. I read that they're incorporating a lot of horror elements into this and that the final movie will be pretty bloody. So that's something to look forward to. Also the R rating which it is rumored to have. 

2018-07-31 18:53:59 I guess it's fine that MoviePass won't let me use it on new a mainstream movies when the trailer lets me watch it for free 
2018-07-31 18:54:21 wow that cgi is awful, looks like it's from the early 2000s at best.
2018-07-31 18:54:23 Not trashing on this movie, but do people really enjoy movies where the characters aren’t organic through 90% of the film?
2018-07-31 18:54:39 Studio exec: Tom we have a problem with your voice, it's hard to understand.

Tom: You want me in this film or not!

Problem solved.
2018-07-31 18:54:48 Yay, another Tom Hardy role where we'll only be able to understand half of what he's saying.
2018-07-31 18:55:07 Tom Hardy must have it stipulated in every contract that his character be difficult to understand. 
2018-07-31 18:55:11 the CGI still looks pretty ruff - ah man, i wished sony hadn't fast track this one, could have been a great movie with a better script and some well finished CGI but this in its current state looks like a ... turd in the wind! you can clearly see the love for venom but the rest, i mean come on - when u gonna learn sony? 
2018-07-31 18:55:12 Was the villain Carnage?
2018-07-31 18:55:18 can't understand what venom is saying, can someone translate?
2018-07-31 18:55:20 The dialogue is still terrible
2018-07-31 18:55:29 Oh cool. A new Upgrade movie.
2018-07-31 18:55:31 So... they’ve still not said if this is rated R or (sigh)... PG-13?
2018-07-31 18:55:39 His acting makes me think of "what if rainman got the symbiot"?
2018-07-31 18:55:44 Ah ah ha ha is this an r/whoosh?
2018-07-31 18:55:48 I still wish they would have gotten the guy who did the voice of The Darkness in the games. But this movie is definitely going to be a watch for me. Not opening day, but definitely the first week. 
2018-07-31 18:55:51 Was that carnage at the end? Kind of looks like their iconic scene of them fighting each other, but missing Spiderman stuck in the middle
2018-07-31 18:56:06 Anyone else think that the CGI looked kind of shit? Could be waaaaay better than that
2018-07-31 18:56:22 Should just rename this prototype
2018-07-31 18:56:49 Looks like rich-Indian-guy-funding-unethical-research is the hottest choice of villain now
2018-07-31 18:57:06 Honestly should've heald off on this until Tom Holland got rid of the black suit, OT would've paid off properly then
2018-07-31 18:57:12 I fucking hate how every trailer now has to grab the kid's attention with loud noises and a big KABOOM at the start of the trailer.  

Have we gone that far back that we now have to blast people's ears out the first 5s otherwise they leave?
2018-07-31 18:57:31 This really makes me think of Prototype..
2018-07-31 18:57:44 That audio mixing at the beginning of the trailer was horrendous.
2018-07-31 18:58:06 As much as I love what I’m seeing so far, the venom cgi, especially during the part where he licked that dudes face, is very... not good.
2018-07-31 18:58:12 The way I see it, we can do what ever we want.

Man this trailer is so much better than the first! Love Venom, can’t wait for this. Hope it turns out good!
2018-07-31 18:58:16 Dare I say that I saw Carnage in there at the end? 
2018-07-31 18:58:27 Was that an enemy symbiote?  Scientist man releases Carnage to counteract Venom?
2018-07-31 18:58:31 Remind me of prototype game
2018-07-31 18:58:34 I can see why people don't like it but I really enjoyed the trailer.  Looks like it will be fun.
2018-07-31 18:58:52 I'm 100% sure there was a meeting between Marvel and Sony execs on the precise number of milliseconds the Marvel logo could be visible in this trailer.
2018-07-31 18:58:58 -sigh-
2018-07-31 18:58:58 Dude WTF is up with these trailers before trailers this shit is so stupid. Who is it for?? 
2018-07-31 18:59:35 Did I see anti-venom of was that my imagination?
2018-07-31 18:59:52 I find it hilarious that this trailer addresses a good bit of the "how does Venom form words if his lips don't touch?"

It shows his lips touching, it shows the face coming away to see Eddie's face talking under it. They picked those shots just to answer nitpickers
2018-07-31 19:01:08 Movie looks pretty good, CGI looks kinda bad, in spite of the design looking solid.  I don't care to much as long as the movie is good.  Nice to see an interpretation that seems to doing the character justice, unlike the shoehorned Sony Executive insert Raimi Venom, that only served to weaken what could have been a much better film without him in it.
2018-07-31 19:01:14 So...... the CGI?
2018-07-31 19:01:50 strange, saw this trailer a few days ago, surprised reddit didn't post it earlier.
2018-07-31 19:01:59 How spoiler filled is this trailer? 
2018-07-31 19:02:08 i had a hard time understanding venom. is this another bane thing? trailer could've been a bit longer /s

DVD watch.
2018-07-31 19:02:23 Why the hell do they play a like 3 second trailer, *right before* the actual fucking trailer?
2018-07-31 19:02:29 Am I the only person who can understand every word said in the trailer?
2018-07-31 19:02:38 SO MANY SNACKS SO LITTLE TIME

Am I the only one sold on this?
2018-07-31 19:03:17 I watch this... like the other trailers... and go.... ehhhh
2018-07-31 19:03:43 Holy SHIT
2018-07-31 19:04:07 They should have just called this “Prototype: The Movie”
2018-07-31 19:04:27 Did Venom's head come out of Brock's arm??  This is going to be so shitty.
2018-07-31 19:04:31 Just like Iron Man had black Sabbath in the credits, this movie should get some music from [Venom](https://youtu.be/fHmzFVDjVnM). 
2018-07-31 19:05:03 I’m just hype for carnage lol
2018-07-31 19:05:59 So are we assuming that anti-venom as the "villain"? Wonder if they will do the whole religious cult thing.
2018-07-31 19:06:06 What that tounge do? 
2018-07-31 19:06:09 Prototype 
2018-07-31 19:06:15 Is Jenny Slate not in this anymore?
2018-07-31 19:06:15 Oh look, the psychopathic scientist trope.
2018-07-31 19:06:21 So...was that Carnage?
2018-07-31 19:07:02 So Woody Harrelson has yet to appear on a trailer. Do we know who he’s playing yet? 

I saw a rumor that he might be playing carnage, but I feel like carnage is to much for a first outing.
2018-07-31 19:07:16 "We can't just hurt people"

"We can do whatever we want"

THIS is what this movie must be about
2018-07-31 19:07:22 Man now I want to play marvel heroes again, oh wait.... Damn.
2018-07-31 19:07:54 this is the most PG13-looking trailer i've ever seen in my life!! even  venom looks "fluffy", too round/smooth. Spawn looked better than this. hell! the Guyver movies had better visuals!
2018-07-31 19:07:59 g'night misses chen
2018-07-31 19:08:20 Venom is a villain goddammit
2018-07-31 19:08:44 Despite the piss poor dialogue, Hardy's weird dialect and the generic "I'm you but stronger" villain, I'm gonna have a hard time giving this movie any less than a 5, because god damn Venom looks terrifying
2018-07-31 19:08:52 Pretty sure we just saw the whole movie.
2018-07-31 19:08:52 Holy shit the audio stitching is horrible in this video..

*I find myself*  ^**questioning** something the government *may not be looking at*
2018-07-31 19:09:10 so is this "ruin the trailer with an advertisement for the trailer right before the fucking trailer" a new trend? because it's annoying. 


also: i understood maybe 1 out of every 8 words venom was saying. 
2018-07-31 19:09:31 It has Tom Hardy in it! That's all I needed to know...
2018-07-31 19:09:35 The hell is is saying at 2:55?

"I have the powatuhsay"?

His accent is weird. Sounds like a drunk Bostonian who just came from the dentist.
2018-07-31 19:09:41 I’m so conflicted. Venom is awesome and I’m a big fan of Tom Hardy. 

But I can’t find any redeeming qualities in these trailers. They look awful. 
2018-07-31 19:09:53 Leaves a bland taste in my eyes. The backgrounds, the characters.... even the colors.... just so bland.
2018-07-31 19:10:07 Please rewrite turd in the wind, it’s soooo bad
2018-07-31 19:10:49 I just don’t know. I love venom I love Tom hardy and I really want this to be good, but I don’t think it’s going to be. I don’t like how there is no spider-man, but I’ve come to expect it. These trailers are just not selling it. I feel like it’s just going to have to be remade in the MCU in 5 years anyways. 
2018-07-31 19:10:55 All those symbiote animations look HORRIBLE! 

The Venom design is all good, but when he is moving at all it looks like an early 3D videogame cutscene on a tight budget.
2018-07-31 19:10:57 Having Riot instead of Carnage as the main villain might actually be a smart move.

Wait to see how people react to the style of this movie and use that information to figure out how to portray Carnage in the next movie. Carnage is such a well-known villain that if you screw him up, fanboys will lose their minds.

Nobody's heard of Riot, so nobody will care if you screw him up.
2018-07-31 19:11:00 I see Inception BWAAAs are back in vogue for trailers again
2018-07-31 19:11:32 The same running shot used twice? Why?
2018-07-31 19:11:33 I just want to know how they are going to tie it in with Spider-Man.

I mean Venom’s whole design and attitude/humor is based off of the time it was bonded to Parker, so unless they have something showing that, it makes zero sense for Venom to look and act like that.

So far from what we’ve seen it was just in a lab.
2018-07-31 19:11:59 I'm having so much trouble understanding what venom says.
2018-07-31 19:12:00 However they spin it, having Riz be the semi-final antagonist at the end would be great. Then Tom’s Spidey pops up as a surprise to maybe stop Hardy? As a little icing on the cake. Lol But that would never happen haha.

I’m 60% sold? from my initial 65%
2018-07-31 19:12:28 Yes, Sony, please show us the person inside Riot, we like that very much.
2018-07-31 19:12:31 Contrary to what a lot of comments are saying in here, I'm a fan of it.
2018-07-31 19:12:48 Amazing
2018-07-31 19:12:56 So what’s it rated??
2018-07-31 19:13:04 So the end is Brock venom vs generic bad scientist bigger grey version venom that probably has some inherent flaw. I'll probably still end up watching this but not really too excited for it. 

Also that guy in the beginning would be Carnage but h kinda jus died...lol
2018-07-31 19:13:19 Can’t say I’m entirely sold on this, but it does look better than the first trailer released.
2018-07-31 19:13:54 This looks awful. How is the CGI worse in this than in Spider-Man 3? How is it Topher Grace's Venom looks better than Tom Hardy's Venom?

Classic Sony! If there was one studio I'd actually like to see Marvel buy, it'd be Sony, just so I didn't have to put up with their gross incompetence any longer, fucking morons.
2018-07-31 19:14:01 Well, that was shit. I'm getting strong 90s Spawn movie vibes. Looks cool, but lacks practically everything else.
2018-07-31 19:14:09 anyone else think that this movie looks like absolute ass?
2018-07-31 19:14:11 Eddie Brock sounds like Charlie Kelly. 
2018-07-31 19:14:21 That quick clip in the university classroom (my guess) looks atrocious lol
2018-07-31 19:14:21 Im just not interested in a Venom movie thats not connected to Spider-man. Even in the comics Ive never cared for Venom while he was with Eddie I did like Agent Venom though and think that character could carry his own mpvie.
2018-07-31 19:14:28 This looks actually awful
2018-07-31 19:14:41 much better than Topher Grace 
2018-07-31 19:14:46 Ok the "We are Venom"- parts are really cool but I think I need subtitles for the dialogue spoken by Venom.
2018-07-31 19:15:12 Venom without Spidey is just wrong. I get changing a bit of the comics because not everything can be adapted but completely messing with the main reason why Venom is like he is is bad imo.

He looks pretty great however
2018-07-31 19:15:31 Not a fan of when the antagonist is essentially as doppleganger of the protagonist. 
2018-07-31 19:15:56 "Oh... I have a parasite, Goodnight Mrs. Chen!" I was bummed he missed being in Suicide Squad.... Not bummed anymore!
2018-07-31 19:16:05 I could only slightly enjoy the movie if I know for certain it will never be connected to the MCU.
2018-07-31 19:16:12 this is the venom we deserve
2018-07-31 19:16:16 41 seconds in, random shot of Glasgow Scotland. Weird seeing your home city in a trailer.
2018-07-31 19:16:25 I wonder if this is going to be a PG-13 movie or R. Some scenes look quite disturbing tbh.
2018-07-31 19:16:26 Really enjoying the marketing for this movie adaption of Prototype. 
2018-07-31 19:16:37 sooo.... was that carnage?
2018-07-31 19:16:40 Ok
2018-07-31 19:16:57 This looks terrible and finally a role tom hardy isn't suited for. Just doesnt sound right. 
2018-07-31 19:16:57 What is he saying at the end there? When he's speaking to the woman
2018-07-31 19:17:14 Fucking chills all over my body!
2018-07-31 19:17:48 Is carnage not red in this movie? One of the different symbiotes looks kinda like him but he’s like grey so I’m confused. Why the hell are they all black though? Or was it supposed to be Riot?
2018-07-31 19:18:25 I really don't like the color palette. 
2018-07-31 19:18:25 Where do his victims go after he eats them and goes back to normal?
2018-07-31 19:18:28 Rolling down the street, like a turd.

Love it.
2018-07-31 19:18:44 I um.. I actually understood everything Venom said. I seem to be the only one here but yeah. I didn't find it hard to understand at all.
2018-07-31 19:18:44 What is this weird thing studios are doing that show a preview before the trailer? It's really annoying, just show the damn thing.
2018-07-31 19:18:54 I hope to God this doesn't catwoman Tom Harry's career.
2018-07-31 19:18:54 This looks amazing.
2018-07-31 19:18:55 That trailer gave so much away I no longer need to watch the film at the cinema.
2018-07-31 19:18:57 It looks like I'm the only one who genuinely thinks this movie looks terrible. I was a pretty big Venom fan when I was a kid and everything about this just looks wrong to me. The way I see it, no Spiderman, no Venom. 

Sony is so desperate to try and cash in on the Superhero movie craze, they don't give a shit if they fuck the source material right up. Well that doesn't mean I need to be hyped for this. I hope someday Marvel grabs hold of the Venom character and does a *proper* Venom story involving Spiderman, like it should be told. 
2018-07-31 19:19:18 In the worlds of Venom “Blargh bungh gah vairn glah glargh phragh!!”
2018-07-31 19:19:29 Bad guy is evil version of good guy....

disposable villian #56
2018-07-31 19:19:42 Not a chance this gets a sequel. 
2018-07-31 19:19:45 What does he have the power to do at the end???
2018-07-31 19:20:10 I've never followed the comics but this looks pretty cool. Still seems super weird to do this without Spiderman though.

I'd love to a see a well-developed, frightening villain like this in the MCU.
2018-07-31 19:20:45 So excited for this movie. Can't wait to see the finished and polished product. 
2018-07-31 19:21:02 Was the guy in the glass cage supposed to be Cletus Kassidy? Or is Carnage not in this movie?

The only female Symbiote I'm aware of is Scream, is that the primary villain?
2018-07-31 19:21:20 And that, folks, is how you fuck up a Venom movie staring Tom Hardy.

What the actual fuck are the people behind this film thinking?
2018-07-31 19:21:27 This looks, sounds, and is edited like it’s supposed to be an SNL Sketch... wtf?
2018-07-31 19:21:32 Like, I'm fully expecting this to break my heart and not live up to expectations, but I love Venom too much to not be excited. At this point I'm just hoping they don't pull a Golden Compass and destroy something I love. 
2018-07-31 19:21:32 the first few seconds...is that tommy wisseu lol 

that aside this was def a better trailer. 
2018-07-31 19:21:44 They should have gotten Henry Rollins to do the Venom voice. He was perfect in The Darkness
2018-07-31 19:22:09 Holy shit that trailer gave away major spoilers.
2018-07-31 19:23:18 Best news of this trailer is, it looks like Venom will actually be featured (at least somewhat) prominently in the film, and not just for the last 15 minutes.
2018-07-31 19:23:23 I see people laughing at Sony hoping to save Carnage for a Venom sequel.

Remember another movie series that saved its best villain for the second movie? The Dark Knight.

Calm down and give Venom a chance. Don’t let this be like Solo, where everyone formed their opinions beforehand and missed out on a really solid movie.
2018-07-31 19:23:25 I understood so little of the dialogue it was like watching a trailer for a foreign film
2018-07-31 19:24:00 I'm not sure where Tom Hardy got the note that "ridiculous accents equal acting" but I wish he'd knock it off. He sounds like Christopher Walken with a harelip.

Also, this movie looks like trash.
2018-07-31 19:24:16 Is it me or it sort of looks like the video game Prototype.
2018-07-31 19:24:22 Y'all motherfuckers need some hearing aids up in here. Venom is not that hard to understand. 
2018-07-31 19:25:31 So it sounds like at the moment this isn't in the marvel universe. Is there any chance that Sony wants to put their venom in the universe though to get more exposure?
2018-07-31 19:25:39 Did anyone else notice the correct pronunciation of symbiote? Well from one character at least.
2018-07-31 19:26:01 Looks like they fixed the dick tongue
2018-07-31 19:26:31 Hmmm
2018-07-31 19:26:36 Being a hardy fan, I think this film gonna be milestone for supervillains films.
2018-07-31 19:26:37 hopfully its more edgy from the first one and more generic
2018-07-31 19:26:42 This looks better then the first trailer, but still doesn't look good. The only thing I'm really excited about is that they have Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady in a small part for this movie. Which means that if this does decently we could get an R rated Venom vs Carnage movie, which sounds really amazing.  
2018-07-31 19:26:46 I watched this in bed this morning at 75% volume on my phone while covering the speaker just in case I woke my wife and I understood the majority of the dialogue. Pretty excited for this movie. 
2018-07-31 19:26:50 I wish I could say I am excited about this. When I heard Hardy was cast I thought to myself I can't imagine anyone better for the role. Then I heard his American accent. Then I saw what is hopefully the interim CGI. 

Also does anyone else have a feeling that Carnage is going to be introduced in a very "Deadpool in X-men Origins" sorta way? Kinda got a feeling that one shot in the trailer was just the big bad when he decides to get his own symbiote.  
2018-07-31 19:26:52 Liked the trailer but I just wish they hadn't shown the other Venom-like thing fighting Eddy Brock's Venom. 
2018-07-31 19:27:14 I don't think this one is getting my money :/
2018-07-31 19:27:58 I just feel like it's not going to be a good movie. Something about it just screams B movie
2018-07-31 19:28:37 I don't have earbuds and I'm in public. I watched this muted, so I wasn't distracted by the weird accent or Bane-level trailer voice distortion.            

Visually it looks interesting. It has the sterilized big studio look, but still some of it is cool.          

I'm curious to watch this with audio later. Venom sure seems to talk a lot.
2018-07-31 19:28:51 So... is the dialogue in the movie going to all sound like spliced together clips or what?
2018-07-31 19:28:58 Wow, somebody saw Upgrade apparently.
2018-07-31 19:29:02 Is the villain supposed to be carnage? Where’s muh red boi?
2018-07-31 19:29:09 I don't know, the CGI is too obvious. Especially when we see Hardy's face inside Venom's face. 
 
Also, Hardy somehow doesn't fit in this role. I'm not feeling it. It's making me appreciate *Spiderman 3* more than I should, even though I thought *Spiderman 3* was bad.
2018-07-31 19:29:34 A much better trailer by far! But dang it they definitely showed too much in this trailer. That scene with the "bad guy" and Hardy fighting over the symbiote. Has to be part of the big end sequence.
2018-07-31 19:29:43 I love the design but already hate the movie. Venom should be a psychological body horror, not another totally-not-hero-guys that will save the world at the end. 
2018-07-31 19:30:04 Is this in the current MCU or is it a stand alone movie?
2018-07-31 19:30:28 This looks awesome. 
2018-07-31 19:30:41 seeing opening night high af
2018-07-31 19:30:50 Eh...honestly not interested without the revenge on Spider-Man aspect of Venom. They make him out to be just a super-powered freak out to eat people...
2018-07-31 19:30:56 [Well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg03q100E4g)
2018-07-31 19:31:12 I was worried about this movie before, and I’m slightly less so now. It might not be fantastic but I think it’ll be ok. I’m just bummed this means we probably won’t get the great incarnation of Venom in MCU that we deserve.
2018-07-31 19:31:24 Was that Carnage ? Or some other symbiote ? 
2018-07-31 19:31:34 I'm not a native english speaker, glad to see i'm not the only one that kept thinking i couldn't understand a fucking word being spoken by Venom
2018-07-31 19:31:44 I’ve never been more hard than i am right now
2018-07-31 19:31:50 This movie looks awful.
2018-07-31 19:32:00 Getting some Ling x Greed vibes here
2018-07-31 19:32:09 Ehhhhhhhhh.... If MoviePass hasn't completely imploded by then I'll see this
2018-07-31 19:32:13 That spliced dialogue after 0:13 is horrible

https://youtu.be/xLCn88bfW1o?t=12s

2018-07-31 19:32:17 The Four Lions sequel is looking good
2018-07-31 19:32:17 Perhaps he would wonda why he would threaten a man....before biting off his head?
2018-07-31 19:32:34 I like how slimy and squishy venom looks. I want to poke him
2018-07-31 19:32:43 This is what the first trailer should have been
2018-07-31 19:33:03 Not getting the Eddie Brock vibe from him. Eddie Brock is a beast of human. 
2018-07-31 19:33:43 I'm surprised so many are complaining about the voice. I thought it completely worked and sounded evil/alien. I have bad hearing and I heard everything lol.
2018-07-31 19:33:48 Always wished to see Tom Hardy portray Wolverine in a future X-men movie. Now I don’t anymore. 
2018-07-31 19:34:03 “Good night Mrs. Cheng” was probably the funniest part of the trailer. I’m actually pretty excited for this movie. 
2018-07-31 19:34:05 Looks badass, still not liking the fact that they are completely cutting out Spider-Man from this origin story
2018-07-31 19:34:06 How can a movie about one of the coolest villains leave me feeling “meh”??? 
2018-07-31 19:34:12 I will never understand why they cant get the modulation to be intelligible in some movies. Last Jedi Kylo sounded like shit with his mask on. Venom is a garbled mess I hope they fix it 
2018-07-31 19:34:13 And the main villian is the scientist. Thx trailer.
2018-07-31 19:34:29 Looks better than the Venom we got in Spiderman 3...
2018-07-31 19:35:09 the Venom suit is perfect. aside from the lack of spider symbol, but thats Sonys fault for insisting on making a Spider-Less cinematic universe
2018-07-31 19:35:16 Now I know the reasoning for having Tom Hardy masked in majority of his major roles. We can't understand him without the mask so they use the mask to dub his speech better...
2018-07-31 19:35:24 This looks like if they made a movie out of that game "Prototype" 
2018-07-31 19:35:25 Ugh
2018-07-31 19:35:26 The world has enough super hewoes 
2018-07-31 19:35:41 the way venom's mouth moves when he talks looks way less like Terrence and/or Phillip in this trailer!
2018-07-31 19:36:03 Will this be R-Rated you think? Wish it was
2018-07-31 19:36:20 If I pull that Symbiote off, will you die?
2018-07-31 19:37:02 From the looks of it, at the end of the trailer Eddie has become...well...kinda villain(?), Biting people's head off. Kinda sucks if that's the movie ending just like what they did in Amazing Spiderman 2.
2018-07-31 19:37:05 Aw man I am SO glad that they show the final fight in the trailer! Lets us see the badass evil symbiote in action early!

/s
2018-07-31 19:37:56 Ive got a parasite...yeah...its a parasite... gotta feed my parasite... its 5 oclock... 5 oclock... have to feed my parasite... yeah...

Tom Hardy is Rain Venom.
2018-07-31 19:38:00 The reveal of Riot was completely unnecessary. 
2018-07-31 19:38:15 They should just do a big crossover event with all their licenses not owned by Disney...This is off the tomh so take it for what it is. Feel free to clarify who owns what, because when writing this, it was a shitstorm, then when I got out of the bathroom, I couldn't find who owns what.

2018-07-31 19:38:21 so this movie explains his origin?
2018-07-31 19:39:09 It's looks pretty good, but they are doing just about everything wrong! Fucking exposition monologues, his accent is just weird, the jokes are completely unnecessary and don't fit the character, the villain (dude in the lab) is going to be in the top 5 weakest marvel movie villains for sure, and the big symbiote villain is a clear, obvious, totally unashamed rip-off of Iron Man 1, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Ant Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange etc. And by that I mean the bad guy is a bigger, stronger, evil version of the protagonist, literally the oldest and most overused final boss battle cliche ever.

But Venom himself doesn't seem too bad, of course with the exception of being an anti-hero. Who the fuck would pick Venom as the good guy??
2018-07-31 19:39:26 The way he utilizes his arms made me think of Parasyte.
2018-07-31 19:39:28 That was antivenom at the end in the white suit, right?
2018-07-31 19:39:44 I give this movie two turds in the wind!
2018-07-31 19:40:06 Well we know now that the main villian is going to also turn into his own "Venom" probably during the climax of the film.

Once again another trailer ruining part of the movie.
2018-07-31 19:40:42 "Eyes! Lungs! Pancreas! So many snacks, so little time!"

[I, for one, am super happy the Venom quote that stuck out the most for me from the comics, is in the movie!](http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/VenomCannibal1.jpg)
2018-07-31 19:40:47 That CGI is so bad. Really not convinced by these trailers. Btw, is it me or was the voices' volume really low?

For someone who only watched the 90s cartoon Spiderman: who was that silver venom?
2018-07-31 19:41:07 I'm so fucking conflicted right now.
2018-07-31 19:41:09 Anyone know who Brock is fighting in this scene towards the end? [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/CAD2wJJ.jpg)
2018-07-31 19:42:00 I find it interesting how people are reacting quite negatively to this trailer. Not saying that it's unjustified, I'm just not sure if it's the current trend to hype up certain movies but hype down pretty much everything else. Or maybe there's just something genuinely wrong with these movies, I don't know. I only say this because I worry this behaviour only hinders a good many potentially good movies from receiving a fair reception once they're released. 
2018-07-31 19:42:42 Riot is the main villain. Looks like there is also Scream/Agony. Didn't see any other symbiote (distinctly anyway).
2018-07-31 19:42:53 Opened the link and saw a run time > 3 minutes... ffs. I don't know how much of the story they ruined by revealing major plot points but I didn't stick around to find out.
2018-07-31 19:43:01 Will this be rated R?
2018-07-31 19:43:06 Venoms shapeshifting reminds me of the Prototype
2018-07-31 19:43:20 I just wanna quote something from the Wikipedia page for this film, addressing its place in the MCU: 

"Marvel Studios is not involved with this film, and does not plan to integrate it with the MCU, but Sony does consider it to be set in "the same world" as MCU films such as Spider-Man: Homecoming, with producer Amy Pascal describing Venom as being "adjunct" to that world."

Don't know if this is still the case but I find it interesting that Marvel don't seem to consider this a part of the MCU, but Sony does?
2018-07-31 19:43:44 I'm still indifferent. 
2018-07-31 19:43:44 Ok, can ANYONE tell me what Eddie Brock's last line in the trailer is The closest I can get is:
  
>Oh (fuck) I have a power to say. Yeah. Night, Mrs. Chen.
2018-07-31 19:44:50 First movie in history to riddle dialogue with the words “pancreas” and “turds.”
2018-07-31 19:45:09 The way they can integrate spidey. My idea is that Spidey and Venom face off. The symBYEote realizes spidey is stronger so decides to leave brock and bond with spidey. 

Brock becomes mad at spidey for taking the suit, black suit spidey stuff ensues. Spidey gets rid of suit only to find it's way back to eddie changed cuz of spideys DNA. 

There u have the spider powers and the symbol. Done. 
2018-07-31 19:45:59 Nice to see my city (Glasgow) in the trailer. This film does look truly awful though. 
2018-07-31 19:46:00 Everything about the aesthetic of this movie, from the massive amount of "out-of-suit, but with tentacles doing all the work reflexively" to the whole Venom head popping out to have a chat with Eddie just makes me think that this was most likely an unused script for an ill-advised adaptation of The Darkness that rightfully never got out of production Hell 
2018-07-31 19:46:17 They're going to need subtitles. The audio is horrible. 
2018-07-31 19:46:24 I'd rather they ignore venom altogether than the butchery that is them attempting to put him on screen
2018-07-31 19:46:30 I feel like I don't need too see the movie now. Whenever I see a trailer that long I assume it's going to be bad. 
2018-07-31 19:46:50 He looks and sounds great. Unfortunately this is the completely wrong way to do a Venom movie.
2018-07-31 19:47:08 A Spiderman/Peter Parker cameo would have made this trailer. Otherwise, this movie feel irrelevant and detached from the current Spiderman universe.
2018-07-31 19:47:09 Sounds like the voice of the guy who played the Wishmaster.
2018-07-31 19:47:23 Well, then. I have never been so happy to have been wrong about something.
2018-07-31 19:47:28  The way it just takes over his body seems more like Ghost Rider than Venom. Their relationship doesn't look very *symbiotic*.
2018-07-31 19:47:37 damn this looks awful
2018-07-31 19:47:42 Well this is clearly fuego
2018-07-31 19:47:45 Wow. Okay, so...I've been saying a Venom without Spidey doesn't interest me. And the first trailer didn't change that opinion. But...I'm suddenly interested. This looks fun. 
2018-07-31 19:48:29 Full disclosure, I watched this at work without speakers. That said, I still don't like the way Venom looks. I think the CGI for the tentacles doesn't look incredibly convincing, and from what I could tell Venom hardly really opens his mouth when he talks.

That said, I'll still do my due diligence as a fan of the character and go see it.
2018-07-31 19:48:39 It’s kinda creepy for a comic movie. I like the way it’s headed.
2018-07-31 19:48:43 I don't think I'll be able to watch this without subtitles. It's so hard to make out what venom was saying
2018-07-31 19:49:00 The CGI is actually digusting
2018-07-31 19:49:13 Started from Bane, now ended up as Venom.
2018-07-31 19:49:20 Yup, still don’t care 
2018-07-31 19:49:50 "Oh, I have a parasite" lmao
2018-07-31 19:49:54 seeing more of venom has really turned me around on this movie. 

I might actually see it opening weekend now.
2018-07-31 19:49:56 Comedy fell flat and doesn't fit. God i wish this was more horror themed. Venom looks a bit better than i expected i guess?, i mean he's a bit muscled but i wanted him to be more like a super bodybuilder type. I mean i like this trailer and the one before don't get me wrong, even though there was alot of negativity i still enjoyed them and thought of the potential.
2018-07-31 19:50:23 Anybody else think his accent sounds too Scottish or something? Especially in the scene in the street when he says "so many snacks, so little time." 
2018-07-31 19:50:33 It looks *so* bad.
2018-07-31 19:50:51 Fucking horrible man
2018-07-31 19:51:17 Hola me gusta el video  tengo in canal en YouTube de P.R. se llama Viajando con Mr. Marrero apoya mi canal es de los Pueblos de Puert Rico .
2018-07-31 19:51:31 Hardy getting to play two iconic villains in the two different Superhero Universe is so worth it.
2018-07-31 19:51:44 Why all the hate on this movie?  Visually at least this movie looks amazing. 
2018-07-31 19:52:19 Yeah no. With every single thing I read/see regarding this film, I become more certain that Venom just cannot and should not ever exist completely independent of Spider-Man. His hatred for Peter Parker/Spider-Man is core to his character and the back and forth between the two of them is part of what makes Venom such an interesting character overall. You can have spin-offs, but only once Spider-Man has been established to exist in the same universe and the two have interacted before. If you take Spider-Man away, you get something much more shallow and you no longer even have a good reason for Venom's pseudo-spider powers, as presumably this symbiote was never bonded to Spider-Man at some point.

Looks like a turd in the wind, folks. Don't hold your breath for this one.
2018-07-31 19:52:25 Tom Hardy to the producers “Guys you don’t want to do this, trust me”
2018-07-31 19:52:33 Maybe I'm the only one but I thought it looked alright
2018-07-31 19:52:52 Is it just me, or does his stilted speech, tone, and word choice make it sound like he is mentally not all there?  "...but I found something......really bad."
2018-07-31 19:52:52 That just seem like a really stupid movie
2018-07-31 19:52:56 Tom Hardy sounds like he's doing his best Tommy Wiseau impression. 
2018-07-31 19:53:06 Please, please be good. Hell I’d be ok if it was just passable. I was so excited for this movie, but I’m not too sold on it just yet. I’m really hoping the trailers don’t represent the movie. 
2018-07-31 19:53:42 Tom Hardy just isn't very good at accents is he  
2018-07-31 19:53:50 This looks pretty awful.
2018-07-31 19:53:52 The CGI does not look great, especially the part where Eddie and the other guy get exposed from their symbiotes. 
2018-07-31 19:53:52 Venomeh
2018-07-31 19:54:23 Tom Hardy? More like Tom hardly understandable...
2018-07-31 19:54:38 Wait, who's the villian/antagonist? I heard Riot was going to be but that looks more like baby's first carnage
2018-07-31 19:54:59 He looks and sounds like the guy from Fern Gully.
2018-07-31 19:55:03 I hate that modern movie trailers now have a stupid pre-trailer before the video. Like I need to be reminded what I just pressed play on.
2018-07-31 19:55:07 Why does he sound like Elmer Fudd?
2018-07-31 19:55:09 I’ll go see it for sure because of the cast but damn, I really can’t get excited for this.. 
2018-07-31 19:55:10 Wow.
2018-07-31 19:55:20 Who is the silver symbiote at the end?
2018-07-31 19:55:59 Topher Gracefully aged.
2018-07-31 19:56:09 Now I don't have to watch the movie, yay
2018-07-31 19:56:13 Is hardy gonna play every goddamn villain possible? They shouldn't let actors play more than 1 villain character per career. You got your Bane, let someone else get their super villain 
2018-07-31 19:57:10 Is... is Hardy playing Eddie Brock as... retarded?
2018-07-31 19:57:22 I like Tom's take on Brock's accent it's deep Pennsylvania.  You don't run into many people with it that thick anymore language has become so homogonized across the U.S., like the Bronx honk, it's endangered.  But I like hearing the traces of the past in his performance.
2018-07-31 19:57:23 Which is worse, michelle williams’ wig or tom hardys indistinguisable lines
2018-07-31 19:57:51 are they really doing the  "villain has the same powers as main character but BIGGER-ER" half way through the movie thing AGAIN?
2018-07-31 19:58:21 This is such a poor trailer.

Like, sure, it works well enough for anyone who's a fan of the character, and has a pretty good grip on who Venom is, but what on earth does it tell someone who hasn't even heard of Venom?

If you're just a random person watching this trailer, then you'll have absolutely no idea what it's supposed to be about. It's just Tom Hardy turning into a big black goo monster and threatening to eat people. It doesn't sell it as a sci-fi movie, or a horror, or even as a superhero movie. It's just flashes of Tom Hardy covered in black slime.

One thing that worked so well with the first Avengers trailer, is that it sold it as an alien invasion movie first, then built up towards showing the Avengers as the trailer went along. That worked really well for the audience, because you didn't need to be a Marvel fan to understand the idea of the movie.

Venom is the exact opposite. It's basically just 3 minutes of "look! It's Venom!", and if you've never heard of Venom, that means absolutely nothing to you.


2018-07-31 19:58:32 FIX THE AUDIO. WHAT THE FUCK IS HE EVEN SAYING AS VENOM
2018-07-31 19:58:38 that fokin tongue tho
2018-07-31 19:58:44 I'm curious, but the "I'll eat your arms, legs, and face" bit at the end was a little too edgelord for me
2018-07-31 19:59:01 I really want to see eddie Brock interact with venom because I like tom hardy, but I have a feeling this is going to turn out like Suicide quad. They will make him out as the "anti-hero" but will end up saving the city. I'm ready to be dissappointed
2018-07-31 19:59:12 IIRC the same thing happened with Dark Knight Rises as happened here- a trailer came out and everyone went "Am I supposed to be able to understand Bane? Cause I can't with all the growling" and then they totally changed his voice for the actual release. Think they'll do the same here?
2018-07-31 20:00:20 He still reminds me of the Violator from that awful Spawn movie in the 90s. 
2018-07-31 20:00:55 What's venom's deal? Can someone do a TLDR for me as I don't get if Tom Hardy is in control, or Venom, or both of them, or what venom wants to achieve.
2018-07-31 20:00:55 I'm a sucker for CGI characters with unique voices. Ryuk by William Dafoe, Thanos by Josh Brolin... I'm digging venom in this list too.

Though the CGI and action scenes remind me a lot of Transformers. Will need another trailer to convince me.

Edit: need to add The BFG and Davy Jones and Gollum and Smaug.....love them all 
2018-07-31 20:02:04 That looks tight. 
2018-07-31 20:02:16 Omg
2018-07-31 20:02:21 This thread is fucking hilarious 
2018-07-31 20:03:14 Why does Tom Hardy insist in sounding unintelligible for every role? 
2018-07-31 20:03:39 Another movie where the finale is the Hero vs an evil version of the hero...

I hope it won't come to being that predictable
2018-07-31 20:05:11 another Sony trainwreck, yay
2018-07-31 20:05:21 What does he say at the end to Mrs Chen?
“Oh I didn’t have the power to save”?
2018-07-31 20:05:25 So glad Riz Ahmed is slowly getting into bigger films
2018-07-31 20:05:34 Venoms voice sounds like James Earl Jones struggling to eat a lot of toffee. 
2018-07-31 20:06:05 What mildly bugs me about the premise of this movie is, they've already killed off the potential rivalry between Eddie Brock and Peter Parker that the source material was based on. Eddie is already a reporter here apparently, but current iteration of Peter is a high school kid. There isn't really any way those two can be "rivals".

I'm okay with the symbiotes being a lab experiment and not alien tech though. Sometimes you need to tone down the wackiness of the original storylines.
2018-07-31 20:06:14 [4k version if anyone wants it not sure if its pure 4k or not](https://youtu.be/ezEWIxbcDVY)
2018-07-31 20:07:13 Help me out here.  Is the guy at 47- 57s  Cletus Kasady (Carnage)? God I hope it is - He was one of my favorite villans as a kid growing up reading the spider man comics. I knew I liked him on issue one when he was introduced. 
2018-07-31 20:07:14 Ah there it is.  The equally powered "bad" guy to fight.

Don't get me wrong, I will see this and probably enjoy it, it's just that... come on.
2018-07-31 20:07:20 Sheesh this looks dark
2018-07-31 20:07:25 Was that carnage at the end?
2018-07-31 20:07:32 I said it after the last trailer but Tom Hardy sounds like Simple Jack
2018-07-31 20:07:38 I'm so pissed off because he looks amazing but this movie is going to be so bad. SONY. MAKE A GOOD FUCKING MOVIE FOR ONCE. 
2018-07-31 20:08:06 Was that Anti-Venom in the fight right before the end sequence? 
2018-07-31 20:08:32 I still have no idea what to make of this movie.  But I guess playing Eddie as kind of a victim of Venom makes sense if they're trying to make him heroic without Spider-Man in the origin.
2018-07-31 20:08:43 Oh great another superhero movie can’t wait #killme
2018-07-31 20:08:57 Is this version of Venom weak to sonic attacks and fire?
2018-07-31 20:09:14 It's just funny how they're making a movie about Venom without Spider-Man and just replacing him with a "Bad Guy". You could make a better movie if they bonded Venom with a Spider and it got out and it bit the main Protagonist transferring the parasite to him/her, And in some way having Spider-Man's powers. As usual Sony wants to fool around with a really cool character and Shit them out before they lose the rights. It's actually scary that you could go on the Internet and find a better written Fanfiction than a Movie funded by Sony

2018-07-31 20:09:31 Does anybody like this weird intro sequence that trailers do now? Like, I don't need a preview for this preview. The trailer is only 3 minutes long and you think that I need an even shorter trailer to sum up that trailer.
2018-07-31 20:09:33 that was way better than the other trailer
2018-07-31 20:10:12 The Darkness was a cool game
2018-07-31 20:10:36 I couldn't understand anything Venom said at the end.

It looks "meh" to me in general, though I did laugh at the last line.
2018-07-31 20:10:57 > I always seem to find myself questioning something the government may not be looking at.

How many different actual lines did they cut that together from?

I'm not even sure it makes any sense...
2018-07-31 20:11:10 This doesn't look like a movie I'd want to watch. Certainly not pay for...
2018-07-31 20:11:25 But still...what is this movie rated. It looks like it should and could be R but for some reason I think they made it PG-13
2018-07-31 20:11:26 A few things:

 - The symbiotes look good

 - Some of the animation isn't the greatest

 - The tone of the film seems better than the other trailers made it look

 - Still not seeing it in theaters
2018-07-31 20:11:47 I’m a simple man. I see Tom Hardy, I go to the movie theatre.
2018-07-31 20:12:08 "Turd in the wind."

Just when I thought The Meg was going to be this year's indisputable guilty pleasure, Venom just raises the bar with every trailer.

This doesn't look particularly good, but damnit, this looks stupid fun.
2018-07-31 20:12:12 I bet you there are going to be some parents who bring their little children to this movie thinking it’s a superhero movie. 
2018-07-31 20:12:26 Yes the voices are weird but I had no problem understanding any of the words on my tiny phone speaker
2018-07-31 20:12:48 Does Hardy just have it written into his contract that he definitely gets to do a bad/weird accent no matter what?
2018-07-31 20:12:53 Why is he talking like Mike Tyson?
2018-07-31 20:13:03 pass
2018-07-31 20:13:33 The black screen after each cut is so damn annoying
2018-07-31 20:13:44 Can they please not give everything away in the trailer?
2018-07-31 20:13:55 isnt he just a “villain” like suicide squad were “villains”... i.e. killing only bad people and saving the world? seems like he saves his girlfriend multiple times, meh

i would like to see someone make a true villain wins movie. ive never seen such a thing
2018-07-31 20:13:57 Wait was that Carnage?
2018-07-31 20:14:10 What's with the gurgling noise that every sci-fi alien monster makes? 
2018-07-31 20:14:16 is this not gonna be R??

:(
2018-07-31 20:14:31 Venom looks big
2018-07-31 20:15:36 Reminds me of prototype .. great game 
2018-07-31 20:15:38 so the final villain is spoiled again in a trailer? nice work sony.
2018-07-31 20:15:39 So another comic movie where the main character fights a bad version of itself? 

I know Carnage is that...but at least there is some variation in that character outside of just the color red. 
2018-07-31 20:15:40 Haha, they fixed the pronunciation for Symbiote in this trailer.
2018-07-31 20:15:48 Maybe this is a reverse suicide squad? Bad trailer but still a good movie?

Regardless I think Ill pass on seeing this in theatres. Its hard to understand venom and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a high schooler trying to impress his cousin majoring in theatre at a community college. That is if I can even make out the dialogue. 
2018-07-31 20:15:49 Oh god it’s gonna be so hard to understand what venom is saying without captions 
2018-07-31 20:16:21 I definitely see the horror element to this film especially with venom having that Killer Clowns From Outer Space design to it but then I also see how it’s still a Sony Spider-man flick. I think forcing two of these genres together is a bad idea and this could have been great if they went full on deranged horror but Sony just can’t leave well enough alone.
2018-07-31 20:16:22 Man, you guys REALLY hate this movie. 
2018-07-31 20:16:54 I’ve heard conflicting reports but this is not part of the MCU right? 
2018-07-31 20:16:57 Why isn't Carnage red? :(
2018-07-31 20:18:21 Why do a lot of trailers suddenly have to put an intro at the beginning of the trailer, like what is it good for?
2018-07-31 20:19:42 Was Jenny Slate cut from this movie? Lol
2018-07-31 20:19:52 A lot of people shitting on his voice. The gurgle seems kinda cool. I love where CGI technology is today, I just hope they dont have a bad story.
2018-07-31 20:20:15 Can we get subtitles for Venom's lines? I can't understand anything he's saying.
2018-07-31 20:21:50 I wanna know what dipshit music supervisor didn’t do everything he/she could to license Tool’s 46&2 for this movie. Hell, at least get someone to cover it. 
2018-07-31 20:22:48 Is this going to be rated R or what?
2018-07-31 20:23:21 I sincerely hope this is rated NC-17. With all this talk of mutilating bodies, they better show lots of blood.
2018-07-31 20:23:24 Why does brock have downes?
2018-07-31 20:23:26 If you watch Peaky Blinders then it's easier to understand Hardy in this movie
2018-07-31 20:24:08 Oh boy my tattoo will have relevance
2018-07-31 20:24:17 0 expectations for this movie.
2018-07-31 20:24:24 The venom suit will only appear 5 mins from the end of the movie. Mark my words! 
2018-07-31 20:24:31 All y'all talkin about accents and cringey jokes and all, and no one is mentioning that was probably fuckin' *Carnage* he was fighting near the end there. 

IDGAF if Brock sounds like Elmer Fudd. IDGAF if Venom makes lame jokes. As long as Carnage is a maniac psycho rampaging murderer who needs to be stopped and Venom stops him, it's all good. 
2018-07-31 20:24:59 Unfortunately this trailer has me less excited about the movie.
2018-07-31 20:25:38 Looks great, his Venom voice is ok but his regular voice still sounds like a kids voice
2018-07-31 20:25:42 i dont care about shitty remakes spiderman has been done 3 times since 2000
2018-07-31 20:26:29 Bold choice for Hardy to go for a bad Christopher Walken impression when portraying Eddie Brock. 
2018-07-31 20:26:40 What did Tom Hardy say at the end of the trailer?

I can't understand it no matter how many times I replay it.
2018-07-31 20:26:49 [deleted]
2018-07-31 20:26:59 Man, this... this looks kinda bad.
2018-07-31 20:27:15 Slightly better trailer, but this still looks pretty bad. 
2018-07-31 20:27:29 It has been interesting seeing the practical effects scenes get used without the CG, then reincluded with more of the finished CG. It is turning out to look pretty damned awesome. If they keep going this way and making it look more organic (and less symbiote floating on the top of his sweatshirt) this should look pretty fucking cool

(example: the office room where all the people and tables split side to side. The big symbiote with the axes wasnt in that clip during the last trailer, but the people and office furniture falling was. Same with the SUV's getting tossed away from the motorcycle)
2018-07-31 20:27:33 Tom Hardy's accent is soooo bad in this. 
2018-07-31 20:27:38 Eeeehhhh... Naaaah. Hard pass from me. 
2018-07-31 20:28:35 I wonder if this is gonna be rated R or just PG-13?
2018-07-31 20:29:46 How many fucking OFFICIAL trailer does a movie have nowadays lmao
2018-07-31 20:29:53 Was that Anti-Venom?
2018-07-31 20:30:46 Ahh it's old fuckface mc spermeye. My favorite villain hero!
2018-07-31 20:30:55 Things Venom said: 
>>Eyes, Lungs, Pancreas...so many snacks so little time! -Venom

Those seriously sound like the least appetizing parts of a human being, but maybe I'm wrong...any cannibals wanna corroborate!

>>We will eat both your arms, then both your legs, then we will eat your FACE right off your head...you will be this arm-less, leg-less, face-less thing, wont you? Rolling down the street...like a TURD...in the WIND!

LoL This is going to be some cheesy fun!
2018-07-31 20:30:58 I'm hyped af
2018-07-31 20:31:08 What happened to lance Reddick?
2018-07-31 20:31:43 Is there confirmation for an R rating?

This movie looks so damn promising.  I hope it kicks off a trilogy; I need darker stories in the superhero era of Hollywood.  I’m so tired of good guy saves the Day stories.
2018-07-31 20:32:01  I continue to be unimpressed with this project. A lot if talent here though, let's hope I'm wrong. 
2018-07-31 20:33:08 That yellow symbiote and the woman suppose to be Scream? Also, riot? Where's my carnage.
2018-07-31 20:33:27 Anybody else have a really hard time understanding what Venom is saying? The distortion really fucks with my ears.

Also Eddie Brock’s accent is awful.
2018-07-31 20:33:38 So Tom Hardy is voicing Venom? Cos I honestly thought it was Lance Reddick! 
2018-07-31 20:33:58 Anyone else think it's really difficult to make out what Venom is saying?
2018-07-31 20:34:16 I remember when I saw the first trailer I thought it was an adaptation of the game Prototype.
2018-07-31 20:34:38 I don't know what it is, but I just don't but. Hardy as a leading man. 
2018-07-31 20:34:41 What does he say to Mrs Chen?
2018-07-31 20:34:50 And the thing is he was so good as alfie in peeky blinders. 
2018-07-31 20:35:03 EB: I'm Eddie Brock. I'm a reporter, and I always seem to find myself questioning something the government may not be looking at. I found something really bad. And I have been...

V: **Eddie.**

EB: Who said that? (who said that, who said that)

EB: ...taken.

Dr. CD: Look around at the world. What do you see? A planet on the brink of collapse. Human beings are disposable. But man and symbiote combined...this is the new race, the new species, the higher life form.

EB: What do you want from me?

V: **We'll find out.**

EB: I'm so sorry!

EB: We cannot just hurt people.

V: **Look into my eyes, Eddie. The way I see it, we can do whatever we want. Do we have a deal?**

V: **Eyes, lungs, pancreas, so many snacks, so little time.**

EB: That power, it's not completely awful.

AW: You have no idea how much you're scaring me right now.

V: **Eddie, cooperate and you just might survive.**

EB: Guys, you do not want to do this, trust me.

Dr. CD (?): Giant leaps will always come at a cost.

V: **We will eat both your arms, and then both of your legs, and then we will eat your face right off your head. You will be this armless, legless, faceless thing, won't you, rolling down the street, like a turd in the wind.**

Robber: What the hell are you?

V: **We are Venom.**

EB: Oh. Uh, I have a parasite. Yeah....'night Mrs. Chen.
2018-07-31 20:35:10 Later that day, pulling out of the drive through...

"First I will eat your meat.  Then I will eat your cheese.  Then I will eat your bun.  You will be this meatless cheeseless bunless *thing* rolling down the street.  Like a turd in the wind."
2018-07-31 20:35:15 The only thing about this movie that doesn’t look dreadful is the special effects. The dialog, the writing, the plot all seems extremely generic and well...shit.

I can’t see myself seeing this, it looks like they’ve wasted the potential for a really good film.
2018-07-31 20:35:23 What's with Tom hardy and constantly doing stupidass accents/voices
2018-07-31 20:35:38 Venom is near incomprehensible. 
2018-07-31 20:36:11 You guys really can’t understand tom hardy? 

I’m iffy about the movie, but will still watch just because of how fucking bad ass venom looks. If it’s a success, I hope to get we get a Carnage sequel.
2018-07-31 20:36:13 This movie looks better with every trailer. 
2018-07-31 20:37:10 When venom says "we" are venom, like the queen does, I wonder if he's referring to Eddie Brock and the symbiote or the symbiote itself
2018-07-31 20:37:47 Eddie Brock Lesnar. Big dude. Weird baby voice.
2018-07-31 20:37:49 Please don't show the climax in the trailer.. 
2018-07-31 20:38:30 No thanks.
2018-07-31 20:38:30 Everybody went nuts over the Bane accent in Dark Knight Rises, just saying. Give it a chance, its tough to judge from a chopped trailer. 
2018-07-31 20:38:34 This type of trailer reveals way too much, I feel like I already know everything about this movie.
2018-07-31 20:38:51 Of course the opening shot of the trailer is of a city scape. 
2018-07-31 20:39:02 when he said he was eddie brock...i'm a reporter it sounded like he was channeling a little bit of his inner walken 
2018-07-31 20:39:02 I actually like this trailer but can somebody please tell me what Eddie says at the very end??
2018-07-31 20:39:52 I can't stand trailers that start with "My name is something something" or "I'm Eddie Brock".
2018-07-31 20:42:31 "What's the point of having that cool face if you're gonna peel it back whenever you talk?"
2018-07-31 20:42:33 Wtf is Sony doing to their movies lately? 
2018-07-31 20:42:51 Amazing Spiderman came out, and then four years later Spiderman homecoming did it bigger and better.
So I'm guessing Venom is gonna come out, and then four years later Marvel is gonna do it betterer and biggerer with the symbiote suit and all that 
2018-07-31 20:43:25 Does the trailer spoiler the whole movie? It's over 3mins long.
2018-07-31 20:43:52 So... [Maximum Carnage](https://i.imgur.com/15zHzZv.png)?
2018-07-31 20:44:10 Since we’ve seen Riot in the trailer, does that mean the other life foundation symbiotes will make an appearance? If so, that would be truly amazing.
2018-07-31 20:45:09 What did he say to the cashier towards the end?
2018-07-31 20:45:11 So that's it huh? We're some kind of Venom?
2018-07-31 20:45:44 much better than the first trailer!! pumped!
2018-07-31 20:45:51 Is that supposed to be Carnage at the end?
2018-07-31 20:46:59 Big ups to Mrs. Chan for not fainting after seeing a monster man who sounds like cookie monster eat a guy.
2018-07-31 20:47:06 Well, Sony has effed up Venom now. Way to go guys, couldn't have just been patient and had it introduced with Spidey and made money with Marvel. 

This looks dumb, generic and worst of all irritating to the fans that want to see Venom as part of the larger story. 

Im underwhelmed and at best will see this on Netflix a year or two from now, when I finally get curious enough to see how bad it was. 
2018-07-31 20:47:20 So is this in the MCU? Or, is it a standalone film? If so, does that mean Spidey can't fight Venom in the MCU? I'm so confused.
2018-07-31 20:47:22 doesnt make sense to be not part of mcu
2018-07-31 20:47:45 3 minute trailer and still have no idea what's going on..so we have that going for us then. 
2018-07-31 20:47:54 Reception in this thread seems to be bad but personally I loved this (excerpt the turd line) and can't wait to see it now! So much better than the first trailer
2018-07-31 20:48:28 Venom is a big guy
2018-07-31 20:48:28 EI'm eddwie Brwock, imha weeporta
2018-07-31 20:49:31 My favorite part was when Venom licks that dude in the face.
2018-07-31 20:49:34 Sooo... when venom eats something... where does it go....
2018-07-31 20:49:42 Have we figured out what universe this takes place in yet?
2018-07-31 20:51:22 What the hell is Venom saying in any of this?  
2018-07-31 20:51:51 This looks so bad, reminds me of an mid 2000's comic book movie in all the wrong ways
2018-07-31 20:52:00 Is eddie supposed to be so awkward? Or is that just the way he is written in the movie? I have never read the comics 
2018-07-31 20:52:11 Venom’s voice needs to be a bit less processed. It sounds awesome but I can hardly understand anything he says.
2018-07-31 20:52:23 Ooooh
2018-07-31 20:52:40 Gives me a prototype vibe
2018-07-31 20:52:48 First trailer had me thinking “I might see this”
Second trailer has me thinking “I’m not seeing this”
2018-07-31 20:53:24 Oh god it looks soooooo bad. Lmao.
2018-07-31 20:53:43 Venom is a great character but he doesn't work as well without Spider-Man. They should do a movie with Spider-Man and Venom, then Venom can get his own movie. Venom is a great character, I hate to see them do this to him. I doubt this will be any good
2018-07-31 20:54:16 I've never understood the appeal or been a fan, I'll pass.  
2018-07-31 20:54:22 Oh Yeah....

.

.

.

.

Still looks like complete dogshit.
2018-07-31 20:54:43 the dialogue is still cringe, but looks cool otherwise, probably gonna end up a cool cliched mess but, hope I' wrong
2018-07-31 20:54:54 This looks like a bad movie with unappealing CGI. I get it, the cheesiness is part of the comics, but they are definitely doing it wrong.
2018-07-31 20:55:17 Did anyone understand Venom?
2018-07-31 20:55:49 Oh Sony, just give it back to Marvel.
2018-07-31 20:56:39 Not seeing a spider on Venom's chest is just weird.
2018-07-31 20:57:03 This looks schlocky as fuck and I dig it. Double feature with Spawn!
2018-07-31 20:57:43 I don't see him using web-like abilities in this trailer so... I guess that's... good?
2018-07-31 20:58:03 Hardy is using his Bob from The Drop voice. I like it. 
2018-07-31 20:58:25 Lots of people who saw the last trailer (including myself): "I bet the part we saw is the only part where they actually show him and at the very end of the movie"

Sony/Marvel: HMB
2018-07-31 20:58:40 TLDW: reddit is not sure anymore
2018-07-31 20:59:12 This looks terrible in almost every way except CGI. I'll buy tickets for the midnight showing.
2018-07-31 20:59:17 "fuck batman"
2018-07-31 20:59:41 Is that...... Carnage at the end?  
2018-07-31 20:59:53 That double arm axe was badass
2018-07-31 21:01:02 As far as Hardy movies go, this looks better than Star Trek Nemesis. Then again, that's a pretty fucking low bar.
2018-07-31 21:01:15 Mannn I’m not trying to watch 3 minute trailer. They give away too much. 
2018-07-31 21:01:16 Every time a trailer comes out I always think they reshot the whole thing because the previous trailer was so poorly received
2018-07-31 21:01:18 “The world has enough superheroes” is much better than the cringefest of “fuck Batman”. 
2018-07-31 21:01:51 God they are rushing this movie so bad. I feel like they are releasing new trailers right after they shoot more content. I'm not looking forward to this
2018-07-31 21:02:24 Without Spiderman, this is only Venom in name. 
2018-07-31 21:02:34 Yeah, I've heard that a few times today. 
2018-07-31 21:02:56 Charlie Gordon is...VENOM!
2018-07-31 21:02:57 Reminds me of "The Darkness" if anybody played that. 
2018-07-31 21:03:11 I feel like I have seen too much. 
2018-07-31 21:03:33 Seeing a lot of not excited comments. Guys I’m sure the plot is going to be ass but come on, when he picked that dude up and said he was finna eat his pancreas? Venom looks scary and that’s all I’m going to see the movie for LOL
2018-07-31 21:03:47 Brought to you by ***FOUR*** writers who's prior credits include: Fifty Shades of Grey, Gangster Squad, The Dark Tower, The Fifth Wave, ASM 2, Jumanji 2, and Kangaroo Jack. 

This is going to look cool, but the narrative is going to be absolute garbage. 
2018-07-31 21:03:48 I have a feeling this thing is going to not do so well in the theaters
2018-07-31 21:03:49 Anyone know what the film will be Rated? Pg-13 or R? I couldn't find much.
2018-07-31 21:04:14 Does it remind anyone of The Darkness? The talking toothy tendril coming out of the back, the fixation on eating body parts, the mental/physical corruption of the host? I doubt it's on purpose but that's the vibe I'm getting.
2018-07-31 21:04:25 Just laughingly bad. What on earth are they think with, really?
2018-07-31 21:04:27 Are we expecting a red band trailer? 
2018-07-31 21:04:29 Alex Mercer?
2018-07-31 21:04:30 This looks awesome
2018-07-31 21:04:32 The venom voice sounds like the [Crysis nanosuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgaELI0LxJw). 
2018-07-31 21:04:48 Awesome trailer i want to see this next movie of Venom.
2018-07-31 21:04:56 Great cast, but other than that...dialogue seems bad. CG needs a ton of work. Villain is just an evil (or more evil) version of Venom. 
2018-07-31 21:05:02 Tom Hardy sounding absolutely Jonah Hill'd
2018-07-31 21:06:49 Fuck everything about this movie...

It might end up being "not bad", but still... fuck everything about this movie.

Why?

Because it butchers the character of one of Marvels most iconic villains for a cash grab.

Do you think Marvel isn't interested in adding Venom (as a character) to their roster similar to how they managed to get Spidey?

Sony wants a movie *now*, and doesn't want to make concessions for the MCU storylines... and I'd guess Marvel probably wants a healthy chunk of cash or the right to use the character for free in order to get involved.

So what we get is this "adaptation" and if they attach this to our current spidey-verse we're stuck with this venom until another reboot.

Fuck this movie.
2018-07-31 21:06:50 Before I watch this.. 3 minute trailer???
Am I about to watch every key part of the movie?

2018-07-31 21:07:10 ohh.. there it goes Venom... and any possibility of having him in the MCU... the visual design of Venom is good, but I'm not feeling the rest. Is that supposed to be Eddie? well, to be expected from such a big change, it's better just to watch it as an unrelated movie :D .
2018-07-31 21:07:36 For a reporter, Eddie Brock seems like a real mook.
2018-07-31 21:07:39 I will give this movie 10/10 if we get a few 1-2 minute scenes of venom following through and just eating 3 people. If you're putting in that kind of insane dialog then you need to have the nuts to back it up.
2018-07-31 21:08:25 This is the trailer we should’ve gotten In the first place 
2018-07-31 21:09:51 Was that a trailer for the trailer at the beginning?
2018-07-31 21:10:02 how many superheroes are reporters or photographers
2018-07-31 21:10:06 Obviously I am super stoked for this movie. 
2018-07-31 21:10:08 Why do trailers have trailers now? 
2018-07-31 21:10:14 My symbiote and I are very excited to see this. 
2018-07-31 21:10:17 Oh look it's my favorite Marvel character, Trash Bag Rainman!
2018-07-31 21:10:22 It would help if I could understand one word he says as Venom. Need subtitles! Main villain looks awful- just a bigger Venom! WTF IS THIS THE SUMMER OF BIGGER THINGS? Shark movie? Sure! Make it a bigger shark. Predator Reboot? Sure! Make it a bigger Predator! 
2018-07-31 21:10:32 So I think I maybe in the minority here, but I'm finding it not that bad. I think venom looks cool, and I want to see more. Some of the writing seems iffy and I'm not sold on the villain just yet. But I'll hold judgement till I see it 
2018-07-31 21:10:42 Most excited I've been for a movie in a while 
2018-07-31 21:11:22 AH YES! I was wondering what I'd eat first! Your spirit, or your body?!
2018-07-31 21:11:27 So, I just stopped watching the trailer at 2:00. I feel that was just the perfect length for this movie. 

I was shocked when I saw that there was almost a minute and a half left of it!
2018-07-31 21:12:15 Turd in the wind, eh?

This one's gonna suck so good, can't wait to see it.
2018-07-31 21:12:26 Venom's voice is so fucking distorted I can't understand 90 percent of what it says.

What idiot was in charge of *designing* this?
2018-07-31 21:12:56 Subtitles: On
2018-07-31 21:14:30 Imagine doing a standalone Venom movie with no Spiderman. Then imagine you'd used Carnage as the villain. What were they thinking not doing this... 
2018-07-31 21:14:34 I barely understood a word from Tom hardy or venom. I swear they were speaking a different language 
2018-07-31 21:14:40 This should have been R-rated for sure. By that I mean, from the beginning. I saw no blood at all. Such a shame, since Venom is such a nightmarish and horrific creation he'd be amazing as a horror movie villain. 
2018-07-31 21:16:19 This looks like something I’ll absolutely see, but it keeps reminding me of Upgrade, and although they’re very different movies, I honestly don’t think Venom will be better.
2018-07-31 21:17:10 Does Tom Hardy's acting here seem stiff to anyone else? Maybe it's just his accent.
2018-07-31 21:17:18 Still looks better than Spiderman 3
2018-07-31 21:17:31 Regardless of how this movie actually turns out, I can safely say I’m at the very least ok with how venom LOOKS in this movie. It’s sooooo much better than that abomination in spider man 3
2018-07-31 21:17:33 There are more things that I like about this movie than things that I don’t like. I don’t like that they’re doing a Venom movie w/o Spider-Man. I don’t like a Venom movie w/o the iconic venom logo on his chest. I love Venom as a character since the 90’s cartoon so I’ll give it a shot. But I don’t expect much. Hopefully I’ll be proven wrong. 
2018-07-31 21:18:02 It's like the old 360 game The Darkness mixed with Tim Curry from FernGully. 
2018-07-31 21:18:07 I’m not hearing many good things said about this trailer in this thread. Is the general speculation that the movie will be bad? 
2018-07-31 21:18:16 They shouldve said 'fuck it' and gone with Gargan style venom. Just this giant cannibalistic behemoth. 
2018-07-31 21:18:42 It seemed like they showed the whole movie in this trailer 
2018-07-31 21:18:58 It's not a parasite, it's a symbiote, Tom Hardy. 
2018-07-31 21:19:22 I'm a bit confused by the tone. I hope they get that right in the movie. 
2018-07-31 21:19:24 Meh.
2018-07-31 21:19:36 Holy shit this writing
2018-07-31 21:19:36 I mean, didn't we have this same issue when Tom Hardy played Bane? I couldnt understand him in that movie either if it wastn for the spanish subtitles.
2018-07-31 21:20:08 "Like a turd in the wind." 

XD
2018-07-31 21:20:11 for being a reporter eddie does not seem very eloquent... more autistic with a side of downs... and yes i know i’m going to hell. 
2018-07-31 21:20:33 Why does riot have like carnage axes and shit they gotta choose one or the other
2018-07-31 21:21:08 This trailer gave away too much. You can see there is that one Lucy Liu looking EMT who obviously also has a symbiote so I'm taking that as eventual opposition, then at the end, you can see the guy who was all "Human + symbiote is the future" fighting Venom with his own symbiote, like a boss fight, I speculate after Venom goes to destroy the research facility
2018-07-31 21:21:25 This is gonna be a hilarious comedy. I'm still laughing at "the guy you work for is an evil person" from the last trailer and this one looks even funnier!
2018-07-31 21:21:33 Looks great.
2018-07-31 21:22:04 I feel like this might have benefited from some animatronic/cgi hybrid work for the closeup shots. Maybe full animatronic torso with a bit of cgi to enhance the face and parts of the body, but what can you do.  I'm having a bit of difficulty buying those speaking shots, but they've got a month or two before release to polish it off.
2018-07-31 21:24:08 I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it actually looks.... okay.

Please, please don’t suck.
2018-07-31 21:24:17 This is definitely the script of the 50 Shades writer. 
2018-07-31 21:24:50 Well this looks like "The Darkness"(game) the movie...
2018-07-31 21:25:18 Jesus christ that trailer was loud as fuck. Calm down a little boys
2018-07-31 21:27:01 I am getting an Ed Norton Hulk vibe somehow...
2018-07-31 21:27:12 This looks better than the previous. Honestly was pretty hyped until the scenes after the credits, terrible dialogue. 
2018-07-31 21:28:07 I know nothing about superheroes and villains. So is Venom actually a good guy?
2018-07-31 21:28:08 Interesting that they seem to be leaving out the symbiote’s connection, rejection by, and infatuation with Spider-Man. It’s been a while but I think Venom even tailored how it looks to be similar to Spider-Man.  Can’t wait to see how it all come together. 
2018-07-31 21:29:01 I always thought the symbiote made his face and mouth contourt.  Not that it just kinda appeared around him
2018-07-31 21:31:18 wtf is that accent.
2018-07-31 21:32:02 Those scythe hands, hand spike, and the dude shooting needles out of his back all reminds me of the prototype games
2018-07-31 21:32:13 Enlighten me: is this movie rated R? Everyone wants it to be, and there are some who claim so, but every trailer so far has noticiblely left out any gruesome details of gore or hard language.

You'd think they'd have pumped out a red band trailer for this by now. 
2018-07-31 21:33:28 @1:45 That’s my parking deck! 
2018-07-31 21:34:57 I hope Spider-Man makes a cameo !
2018-07-31 21:36:32 Someone clarify to me, isn't Venom a villain and not a hero? 
2018-07-31 21:37:33 It really puts me off the (I may say expected) last Hulk and Iron Man formula, Hero: I can "transform/get"  into  a cool "monster/mechanic suit".... Villain: I can too, into a uglier and bigger one, let's fight. :/.
2018-07-31 21:38:08 Tom Hardy always plays a guy I can barely understand.
2018-07-31 21:38:54 I was born in the darkness!
2018-07-31 21:39:20 This part of the mcu or?
2018-07-31 21:40:11 I know we have been let down so many times but damn if there aren't a lot of negative nancys in the comments. I think the character looks great and tom hardy is a very solid actor and a fun choice for brock. Definitely would like to see some carnage but not in the trailers, id like the movie not to be spoiled by trailers for once.
2018-07-31 21:40:47 This trailer looked better than the first one at least, but we keep getting snippets of the awful dialog and that doesn't really make me feel better about it. I also still don't understand how this story even functions without Spider Man. I mean, if they're going to make this a series of movies Venom needs to fight Spider Man. 

I don't know. Part of me really wishes I could love this, but I get the feeling I'm seeing a pig in lipstick.
2018-07-31 21:41:02 Hardy’s accent reminds me of this SNL sketch parodying Guy Ritchie crime movies with British accents that you couldn’t understand at all. So much to a point when they show a critic quote saying if he can turn on subtitles for a movie in English. That’s what I’m gonna need for this. 
2018-07-31 21:42:11 Really digging the look of venom and the action bits. Dialogue still sounds pretty god awful in parts though
2018-07-31 21:42:26 Needs more 2003 MTV Movie Award Winner for Best Kiss Tobey Maguire. At least 7% more. With a My Chemical Romance haircut.  They still have time to CG him in. Until that time, count me out. 
2018-07-31 21:42:34 love tom hardy but his american accent is no good they could have just cast Logan Marshall he looks like him and his acting is great 
2018-07-31 21:42:56 Idk still not excited about this film. I like Hardy as an actor but this just looks bad.
2018-07-31 21:43:41 Judging by the fact that I'll be needing subtitles to understand this movie, I'll just patiently wait for it to be released on Netflix...or Disneyflix or whatever
2018-07-31 21:43:56 That looks way better than I thought it would be and I am totally thrilled to be rooting for the bad guy this time around :D
2018-07-31 21:44:28 The Eddie Brock voiceover at the beginning of the trailer sounds like they used heavy frankenbiting to put it together - like every other word is from a different part of the movie. Likewise, it sounds like half of what he's saying has been digitally slowed down. It's like really lazy reality TV editing there. Why couldn't they just have Tom Hardy record the VO that they wanted?
2018-07-31 21:45:21 I really hope he at least stays as venom in the important scenes, and doesn't constantly pull the mask back for more Tom Hardy face time. That split face reminded me of Topher Grace and I cringed a little bit. 
2018-07-31 21:45:37 First trailer was awful. After #2 ill give it a chance if > 75% rt score.
2018-07-31 21:45:49 Please, please don't suck. 
2018-07-31 21:46:32 at 2:18 Did they just spoil us the movie ?
2018-07-31 21:46:43 I hope that this is a story about Venom, and at the last minute Tom Holland as Spider-Man shows up and beats him with help from the Fantastic Four. THAT would be great. 
2018-07-31 21:47:09 Now that! IS. VENOM.
2018-07-31 21:47:44 This was the trailer we needed to be convinced.
2018-07-31 21:47:50 Is Spiderman going to be on this movie at all? Like not even an appearance 
2018-07-31 21:48:40 Can’t wait!!!!! 
2018-07-31 21:49:04 This looks so damn bad. What a shame.
2018-07-31 21:49:10 Meh
2018-07-31 21:49:36 is he doing a voice? what accent is this? It's like a latin accent of some kind, like slightly italian or spanish?
2018-07-31 21:50:29 It looks generic. The final fight instantly reminded of of the end of the original Ironman with the hero just fighting a bigger "stronger" version of themselves. Venom looks kinda like an unreal engine model.
2018-07-31 21:51:25 For anyone wondering, i estimated his height being 8.5' to 9' tall (259cm - 274 cm) based on Screenshots i made from the trailer and a lot of highly educated mental gymnastic and guesswork.

For anyone... interested in that kind of trivia.

>!I exaggerated on the way i described how i determined the height, please dont take it seriously. The estimation is good though.!<
2018-07-31 21:51:29 the idea of this movie alone is infuriating. it doesn't help that it also looks silly.
2018-07-31 21:51:46 Pass
2018-07-31 21:52:13 Venom is a little hard to understand... 
2018-07-31 21:52:14 OK, so there's so much wrong with this, but I like Venom and I feel like they really captured what makes Eddie and Venom a great pair. I love that Venom has its own character and isn't just a suit.
2018-07-31 21:52:15 This looks the shizzle.

Let's bring back Toby. 
2018-07-31 21:52:37 Everyone's talking about how they can't understand Venom and apparently I play too much Starcraft 2 because he sounds fine to me.
2018-07-31 21:52:39 I kinda love Venoms little grin. He looks so happy, like a child on Christmas eve... about to eat Santa
2018-07-31 21:53:22 Please stop Sony. You don’t have to do this. 
2018-07-31 21:53:49 Why not just let him use his normal accent? He sounds mentally handicapped when he tries do to a blue collar american accent.
2018-07-31 21:53:51 That last part about the arms and legs and such, that reminded me of that one part of The Princess Bride.
2018-07-31 21:54:42 Everyone talking about Tom's accent and i'm just here surprised at how odd is to see a movie where Tom Hardy looks scared
2018-07-31 21:55:24 I started thinking this might be decent until he started eating people 
2018-07-31 21:55:29 i have several questions
2018-07-31 21:55:33 Agony and Riot are two of the five symbiotes members that are seen in this trailer. Can't wait to watch it on release night!!
2018-07-31 21:56:17 Looks very, very, very bad.
2018-07-31 21:57:09 A movie nobody asked for.
2018-07-31 21:57:10 This looks just as bad as the last trailer. 
2018-07-31 21:57:15 This look fantastic 
2018-07-31 21:59:09 Why is nobody seeing this as a perfect Prototype action game adaptation more than the Venom movie!?
2018-07-31 21:59:48 The way the symbiote takes over Eddie reminds me of how that first cup of black coffee consumes my central nervous system.
2018-07-31 22:00:10 Was that "i'm gonna eat your legs and face" scene supposed to be scary or funny? 
2018-07-31 22:01:20 Too shiny
2018-07-31 22:01:45 Keep in mind this is the best material they had.
2018-07-31 22:02:23 Any chance someone can deliver a transcript of this trailer for the normal of hearing? 
2018-07-31 22:03:09 Venom without Spidey just sounds no fun.  This isn’t part of the MCU, right?
2018-07-31 22:03:35 The only issue I see here is the miscasting of Tom Hardy - never for a moment do I see him as quippy, fun and vulnerable.  It's not a coincidence that he is always cast as tough, dark and tortured, that's just who he is as an individual. I applaud him for trying to play against type, but it's not really working in the trailer.  Maybe in the film it will grow on me.
2018-07-31 22:04:00 Wow, they spoiled the whole film within the trailer.
2018-07-31 22:04:15 Is Eddie Brock looking for some "dedotated wam" or something? Lol, cant get over his voice.
2018-07-31 22:06:30 I get it. I get it now. This is a good trailer. Much better than previous. 
2018-07-31 22:06:54 Can anyone tell me wtf is up with the little trailers that have been popping up over the last few years? Like, why are you showing me a mini ad for the shit I am going to watch RIGHT NOW?

What is the point of a mini trailer for a trailer? 
2018-07-31 22:08:02 Can I just say this looks stupid?? Forgive. I’m a huge comic book fan but without Spider-Man it’s just a nonsense, empty excuse to get our theater money. 
2018-07-31 22:08:13 So is this in the same timeline where Spiderman is snapped? 
2018-07-31 22:08:25 Hearing the villian-scientist-corporate-evil-guy talk about how humans are disposable and how he can improve the world by replacing or killing everyone is getting mighty old. Please Hollywood, use those big brains of yours' and think of something new.
2018-07-31 22:09:40 Holy shit
2018-07-31 22:10:32 Im at work so Injaven watched, but does Venom really say “Funky Butt-Lovin’”?
2018-07-31 22:11:32 It looks kind of bad...
2018-07-31 22:11:49 So Abathur is voicing Venom?

https://youtu.be/uVOBLTS0lJc?t=32s
2018-07-31 22:11:54 Movie looks horrible.

What kind of mockery of a film is this? Each trailer has progressively gotten worse. 

Only thing that will save this movie is an R rating with extreme violence. Supposedly he bites off many heads. If we don’t see heads rolling this movie can go fuck itself with all the cash grabbing losers at the studio. 
2018-07-31 22:12:08 That last part about the turd in the wind made me cringe so hard... Ugh.
2018-07-31 22:12:20 They succeeded in getting me hyped for 2 minutes and then reminding me its still just a bad Sony movie in the last minute. Setting them realistic expectations, thanks Sony. 
2018-07-31 22:12:32 Does anybody at Sony actually read the comics? I feel like they took the venom look and just tacked it on to a generic, alien infestation story as opposed to secret wars -> black suit spidey -> venom -> carnage etc. I get that maybe getting spiderman would be hard with him being in the MCU but at least try to stay true to the origin story.
2018-07-31 22:12:33 I love these threads where we can just shit all over stuff
2018-07-31 22:14:10 San Francisco is an appropriate city for a “turd in the wind” metaphor. 
2018-07-31 22:14:36 I dont get what he's supposed to be, but i also dont know anything about Venom.
2018-07-31 22:15:23 Sheesh the dialogue for this...

“Like a turd in the wind”.

I have low expectations for this. It may be a good laugh though.
2018-07-31 22:15:41 I just watched the whole movie.
2018-07-31 22:15:46 Kinky
2018-07-31 22:15:53 Looks awesome 
2018-07-31 22:16:49 Man, if only Marvel Studios could make a Venom movie. That’d be pretty rad. 
2018-07-31 22:17:38 I'm getting a real Charlie Kelly vibe from Eddie Brock here.
2018-07-31 22:18:03 i sure hope they re-work the dialog. that felt really cringy. 

i know the cast i very well capable of much, much more. 
2018-07-31 22:20:35 Michelle Williams is such a good actress. I don't know why she's always playing the go-to bimbo in these blockbusters now. 
2018-07-31 22:22:03 Anyone else love how much theyre stealing from the game Prototype?? (Actual love, not sarcastic love) Venom is gonna crush!! :D
2018-07-31 22:22:42 Well I’ve seen the whole thing now.
2018-07-31 22:25:33 Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/pVzYS3Ga_j8) from ferngully. Minus the singing.
2018-07-31 22:25:34 Oh no. This is going to be terrible isn't it?
2018-07-31 22:25:46 Venom just isn't venom without the tarantula motif.
2018-07-31 22:25:46 The more trailers I see the more convinced I am that this is just Prototype the movie with a Venom skin.

~~Carnage~~ especially fits the bill.

Edit:  Apparently that is some other evil symbiote called Riot.
2018-07-31 22:25:50 Where is that web slinging menace, Spiderman? 
2018-07-31 22:27:07 Noticing that the first installment of superhero franchises tend to feature the hero fighting a sinister/larger version of themselves.

Happens in Venom, clearly, but I'm also thinking of Iron Man (fighting Jeff Bridges as Bigger Iron Man) and The Incredible Hulk. Maybe Batman Begins, with Bruce fighting Raz, is like two versions of similarly-trained/capable fighters going up against each other?

Or are those basically the only three examples?
2018-07-31 22:27:46 I know actors need exposure and screen time yadayadayada but i cant help but feel like the emersion of the movie breaks whenever a charcter ( like venom, spider-man etc) just take off theur mask or show their face in the middle of an epic scene. For what seems like no reason.

Honestly i know id be less frightened after talking to 7 foot tooth demon if it revealed a surprised looking dude inside. 

Thats something deadpool did perfectly. There are scenes where hes not in the mask and scenes where he just keeps it on all the time. Because he is deadpool.
2018-07-31 22:27:47 They should have just used his Bane voice for Venom lol. Just imagine Dark Knight Bane saying that "turd in the wind line"
2018-07-31 22:28:42 Parts of this like the Tentacles with Venom's face on it right around [Here](https://youtu.be/xLCn88bfW1o?t=1m19s), remind me of The Darkness. Like [This](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/thedarkness_hero_vf1.jpg) and [This. ](http://cms.kotaku.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/3-1.jpg)
2018-07-31 22:28:48 Am I the only one disappointed by the fact that Eddie Brock was a ridiculous body-builder in the comics and is some skinnyguy on screen?
2018-07-31 22:31:51 How many accents is he doing in that ADR at the beginning? He’s doing more accents from east coast city’s than Mark Wahlberg has played a cop in. 
2018-07-31 22:32:48 What was the weird filter that kept flashing over Eddies face? It even happened in the same scene used from the first trailer that didn't have that weird flashing filter in the first trailer.

Are they juat chaning things as they go? 
2018-07-31 22:33:18 "Great! Looks great! Can we make the Sym-bye-oat shinier and less visually interesting? It's a boring, slimey mess right now and I want to really punch that part up." _Apparently your typical SONY cinema executive. 
2018-07-31 22:35:31 QOTD: the gooey fight scene, is that antivenom and venom fighting?? The other symbiote looks quite like antivenom
2018-07-31 22:35:53 I know the dude that died in the bodega at the end. 
2018-07-31 22:36:19 Are they still pronouncing symbiote wrong? 
2018-07-31 22:36:21 Somehow I still can't get behind Tom Hardy's voice/accent, it just sounds really odd. And the dialogue still sounds really simplified and bad. Otherwise I'm becoming more intrigued with this movie the more I see it.
2018-07-31 22:37:16 The only way to make this movie look less appealing is to replace Tom Hardy with Carrot Top.
2018-07-31 22:38:04 is venom doing the voice of [serak the preparer from the simpsons?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQumi6zen5Y&feature=youtu.be&t=151)
2018-07-31 22:42:09 If he has giant white spider symbol on his chest, im sold.
2018-07-31 22:51:01 So he doesn't seem to have many "spider abilities"   so a team up next movie with him and spider man vs Carnage and a couple of symbiotes would be cool.  maybe the symbiote bonds with peter at some point and the end we get Venom with spider abilites added
2018-07-31 22:57:06 This trailer is as long as pi.
2018-07-31 22:57:39 We are a little more excited for this movie now. At least this trailer had actual venom in it!
2018-07-31 22:58:38 Intrigued by this 
2018-07-31 23:04:52 Cool, Tom Hardy looks like he's starting to act.
2018-07-31 23:05:13 I am whelmed.
2018-07-31 23:07:29 Why is he talking like that? It sounds like someone has taken apart his sentences and created new ones for comedy. Like those Youtube Poop videos
2018-07-31 23:08:33 Honestly. I’m all in on this. It looks muuuch better than the first trailer. CGI looks solid, especially the parts that had Venom forming extensions from his clothing etc. 

I have a feeling the “I found something bad” line may be two separate discussions in the movie but pieced together in the trailer to make it sound like it’s said that way. 

I have ZERO issues with the “turd in the wind” line and I think it fits venoms character well. He has a very strange sense of humor. He and Eddie combined make it a totally fitting line IMO. 

I’m stoked. Was really worried about this for awhile. My main concerns were venoms look, his onscreen time and the rating. He looks great, seems to be plenty of him, now we just wait to see the rating. 

I’m excited for sure. Has over 3 million YouTube views in 5 hours. May as well start shooting the sequel now.
2018-07-31 23:11:59 Makes the movie seem far more interesting than the first trailer
2018-07-31 23:13:23 Looks like a fun film, but damn I can hardly hear what Venom is saying. 
2018-07-31 23:14:00 They seem to have upgraded the CGI a bit since the last trailer... still something seems off.
2018-07-31 23:14:15 found this on wikipedia and was alittle relieved it'll be connected to the MCEU:


In June 2017, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed that the film was solely a Sony project and Marvel had no plans to connect it with the MCU.[2] However, producer Amy Pascal soon clarified that Sony intended to have their MU films take place in "the same world" as the new MCU films starting with Spider-Man: Homecoming, describing them as "adjunct" to that world. She said that Venom would connect to the next planned film in Sony's MU, Silver & Black, and that there was potential for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to appear in either.[3] The character Carnage was also expected to appear in Venom at that point.[43] In July, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch explained that Sony was not interested in producing "conventional comic-book movies" and was looking to give each film in their MU a distinct style. Venom was considered "a spin on a horror film", inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg but with "more pop and fun". Fleischer said he has "always been drawn to the more antihero superheroes. There's a dark element to [Venom] and a wit that has always appealed to me." He said the film would explore Venom's origins and the "Jekyll and Hyde" relationship that Brock has with the symbiote.
2018-07-31 23:15:14 Why are people saying there are lack of symbiotes with color? Within the first 20 seconds of the trailer we see two colored symbiotes; a blue one and a yellow one.
2018-07-31 23:16:07 I guess this is Marvel covering up the third Spider-Man movie, the original, with this.
2018-07-31 23:16:46 I thought I had accidentally made the video slower. The audio is incomprehensible when it's this distorted.
2018-07-31 23:16:59 We are Venom. We are the Vanguard of your destruction. You exist because we allow it. You will end because we demand it
2018-07-31 23:17:09 Honestly I could not understand a single dialog Venom said. It's already difficult to understand Tom Hardy but Venom's dialog oh! My God 
2018-07-31 23:18:11 Now make a movie about Bizarro - but he's not connected to Superman in any way! 
2018-07-31 23:18:25 we like the look of this 
2018-07-31 23:19:11 What the fuck does he say at the end? To the cashier
2018-07-31 23:20:09 I don't know what's worse. 

The dialogue, those awful accents or the corny ass CGI.﻿
2018-07-31 23:21:34 What's the rating on this?
2018-07-31 23:22:30 I think the first trailer was much better. I feel like they basically just showed the whole movie in this one. I could have guessed on my own that he would be fighting at least one other symbiot. Now they showed it and him using carnage type powers and how he's saving the girl. Something about Venom's lines seem cheesy... "we can do whatever we want"? Why not have a rational debate about how they're trying to hurt him and shoot him. It's fight back or die... but no... "we can do whatever we want." SO intelligent.
2018-07-31 23:22:44 Meh.
2018-07-31 23:22:46 I can't tell if im excited by this or if i feel its another by the numbers, simple 3 act plot movie... like i left the trailer unsure of how i feel. does anyone else know what im saying? anyone else like excited and at the same time not excited for this movie? my best guess is that i WANT to be excited, but my gut is saying "its going to be... average". somebody chime in here
2018-07-31 23:22:46 well this movies \*LOOKS\* potentially kinda cool

the plot and acting and dialogue and everything else is up in the air
2018-07-31 23:26:16 What happens to a body deformed?

      Does it roll down the street
      Like a turd in the wind?
      Or fester like a sore—
      And then run?
      Does it stink like rotten meat?
      Or crust and sugar over—
      like a syrupy sweet?

      Maybe it just sags
      like a heavy load.

      Or does it explosive diarrhea?
2018-07-31 23:26:58 Is it jsut me or does this look like shit?
2018-07-31 23:27:09 im just not felling it 
2018-07-31 23:27:11 well i can't understand half those lines, but it sounds fuckin' cool, and i'm sometimes an audio engineer; you know the thing about these marvel films is they make a fuck load, and it just takes a one or two before you sign over to the whole lot.
2018-07-31 23:28:15 It was looking to gritty and dark until that last clip, gotta love the comedic pause.
2018-07-31 23:29:13 Can anyone transcribe for me the last line to the store clerk? I can't pick out anything he says.
2018-07-31 23:29:16 The Venom design is cool, but I cannot understand a word said by both Venom or Brock! Okay that’s a lie, with Brock I understand him. Just wish his accent wasn’t so terrible haha. 
2018-07-31 23:30:12 When he says "we are Venom" with half his face exposed, he said it it all non-chalantly like eh... Not a bit of viciousness.
2018-07-31 23:30:14 I watched this only hoping his lips touched when pronouncing words properly. Was not disappointed. Good.. glad they fixed that shit
2018-07-31 23:30:25 There's a part of me that wished he had Alfie's voice as Venom. 
2018-07-31 23:33:11 Why does Tom Hardy sound like Christopher Walken?
2018-07-31 23:35:17 [deleted]
2018-07-31 23:37:35 That opening scream sounded like George Costanza.
2018-07-31 23:38:31 I liked everything except the spoiling of the climax. What does Eddy need to fight a symbiote for?
2018-07-31 23:38:36 Carnage isnt red?
2018-07-31 23:40:05 It looks a little goofy when he transforms to be honest.
2018-07-31 23:43:11 I wish they didn't show the guy in riot...at least leave a little surprize....
2018-07-31 23:43:37 This movie is gonna be dope
2018-07-31 23:44:23 WE ARE VENOM
2018-07-31 23:44:41 Why didn’t they save venom for the next spiderman it would have been so perfect tom hardy and the one kid 
2018-07-31 23:49:13 Is it me or does Tom Hardy sound like his character from the movie The Drop like same kind of guy not all there upstairs but smarter than you think
2018-07-31 23:51:44 How much do you wanna bet Eddie throws up carnage in the post credits sequence.
2018-07-31 23:52:11 Quietly excited....
2018-07-31 23:53:01 The trailer doesn’t seem to relieve my concerns that there’s only going to be a short part of the movie where we get to see the full venom. All the full shots of venom were of either him climbing or running on the bridge, the one we saw from the first trailer or the one in the store where he’s trying way too hard to be funny.
2018-07-31 23:53:16 His voice at the end sounds just like Tj miller
2018-07-31 23:54:22 This trailer ruined what expectations I had for this movie and that's disappointing. What's up with that Venom voice? The one liner jokes? The CGI is really really bad. I wish I hadn't seen this.
2018-07-31 23:54:56 Just when you thought Bane was the most unintelligible super villain Tom Hardy could play...
2018-07-31 23:56:48 Sony employees reading this thread be popping their pants
2018-08-01 00:00:18 So it's going to be Venom vs Venom(s)? Or is Tom Hardy's Venom the original?
2018-08-01 00:01:44 Why is nobody talking about Scream? Riot does look sweet but Scream looks awesome. Eddie flying away from her cell and her shooting out symbi-spikes was sick. Wouldn't surprise me to see all the other symbiotes from lethal protector too.
2018-08-01 00:02:25 I am bothered by the way they pronounced symbiote.
2018-08-01 00:02:58 A turd in the wind  might be the better tag line for this film.
2018-08-01 00:04:26 Carnage would have been a better villain than just another venom...
2018-08-01 00:05:28 God i hope this movie is good
2018-08-01 00:06:06 Cool I have now seen the movie.
2018-08-01 00:06:48 Not gonna hold my breath on this one. 
2018-08-01 00:10:13 This movie is going to be the Green Lantern of Marvel.
2018-08-01 00:10:27 dont be next years'tombraider
2018-08-01 00:11:00 We want both your arms and legs so you're wriggling like a little turd on the street.

Damn that was funny and cold. I gotta watch the movie now. 
2018-08-01 00:16:18 this looks pretty sick, but I feel like I just watched the whole action scenes.

the movie feels rly dark, venom could also be a DC character
2018-08-01 00:17:20 [deleted]
2018-08-01 00:17:43 This movie gonna suck but still will watch because Tom he's good actor
2018-08-01 00:18:58 That's gonna have to be opening night for me.

2018-08-01 00:21:03 I watched it and my reaction is "meh". Nothing in that hyped me up. 

2018-08-01 00:21:49 This looks mediocre at best. This movie could've been so much better.
2018-08-01 00:23:31 I still have no clue if this is going to be a good movie or not yet. However, I am 100% sure the action/fight scenes are going to be amazing. 
2018-08-01 00:25:13 Much better!

2018-08-01 00:27:32 I can't wait until this comes to DVD, or starts showing endlessly on daytime cable channels.
2018-08-01 00:28:47 It will be fascinating to see if Sony doesn't fuck this movie up
2018-08-01 00:30:15 this actually looks pretty good. i was a little hesistant when i heard they were making this
2018-08-01 00:30:18 I really can't wait for this movie. I used to collect venom comics as a kid. Seeing this trailer... my jaw is on the ground.
2018-08-01 00:30:53 i need see this movie, venom it´s very important in the world of villains and needed this movie...
2018-08-01 00:31:13 Huh, this one actually makes me interested in the movie. Far more exciting than the last trailer!
2018-08-01 00:35:19 Ok, I get it. They are making it a hulk/dr. banner thing.
2018-08-01 00:35:25 The more trailers I see, the less excited I get...
2018-08-01 00:36:00 Anti-Venom? Is that you?
2018-08-01 00:37:58 What is Eddie saying at the end of of the trailer? 
2018-08-01 00:39:56 I didn't need to see the villains face, feels like a massive spoiler, but yeah. Cool none the less.
2018-08-01 00:41:37 This is how I imagined the game [prototype] movie to look like.
2018-08-01 00:42:02 Why were there two venoms? was one Carnage?
2018-08-01 00:42:43 Where is monark? 
2018-08-01 00:43:18 Boil it down to me being a negative nellie about everything Sony touches, but my hopes aren't super high about this one, which is a shame since Venom is one of the few Spiderman Villheroeians I've really liked.

Meanwhile the MCU took a goofy villain from Spiderman and made him a moderately complex character.
2018-08-01 00:44:05 This looks reliably more awful every time I see a trailer 
2018-08-01 00:44:29 Why's the release been delayed? It's past May I it wasn't in the cinema
2018-08-01 00:48:57 Does it seem like a good(varies) adaptation of Parasyte (Anime) or Prototype (Game) that Venon got shoe-horned into?
2018-08-01 00:49:59 For some reason looking at his face reminds me of Burger king chicken nuggets
2018-08-01 00:51:12 I can’t wait for this movie!! The venom pops look amazing 
2018-08-01 00:54:19 Holy shit! This was awesome! 

"Eyes, lungs, PAN-creaaasss..."

Love how the symbiote talks to Eddie, very "The Darkness" like.

**JACKIE!!! THE HOST WILL SURRRIVVEEE!!!**

It's nice that the other symbiotes are getting their time to shine on the big screen.
2018-08-01 00:54:22 Ouch this looks so bad.
2018-08-01 00:55:04 Am I alone in thinking the actual CGI for the suit looks like it was made 10 years ago? I know it's a trailer and will get cleaned up but seriously. The design is fine and pretty comic true but the actual look is hard to describe. It looks like wet rubber including the teeth, I don't see sharp just rubber mask teeth that would fold over when pressed. 
2018-08-01 00:55:12 TURD. *squish* 

WIND. *waves*

DUDE. *points*
2018-08-01 00:56:51 This is like the 5th sony superhero movie where "evil mad scientist" is the villain.

Spiderman 1

Spiderman 2

Amazing spider man 1

Spiderman homecoming

Venom

Most of these were good, but goddamn are these villains getting tiring.
2018-08-01 00:57:45 Of all the stupid in this trailer, it's the shapeless, third-rate Hans Zimmer knockoff score that annoys me the most.
2018-08-01 00:57:52 I gotta be honest, rewound a few times trying to figure out what venom, and even some of the other characters, were saying. Still don't know many of the lines.

Anyone else? Or am I just daft?
2018-08-01 00:58:05 Is there a pool going on how China will be tied into the movie?
2018-08-01 00:58:20 Sony is the elephant graveyard for franchises.
2018-08-01 00:59:00 This really reminds me of the Catwoman movie. Switch out Halle Berry for Tom Hardy and Sharon Stone for Riz Ahmed, and you've pretty much got the same film. Batman/Spiderman nowhere to be found while a nobody gets powers, walks the fine line between anti-hero and villain, and fights a megalomaniacal evil rich person.   
2018-08-01 00:59:47 Will be bad depending on much the ratio of Sony's direction to Marvel's is.
2018-08-01 01:02:36 It's [Prototype: The Movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc3XptLacMM&feature=youtu.be&t=135) I mean, I'm completely ok with that, but that's exactly what this is.
2018-08-01 01:03:56 Huge fan of Hardy and Venom, but this looks terrible. 
2018-08-01 01:04:03 Am i the only one that doesn’t think this movie will be good? 
2018-08-01 01:04:06 Yaaaaaassss!!
2018-08-01 01:04:08 If only they have an after credits tie in with the MCU. 
2018-08-01 01:07:24 Tommy hardys american accent always sounds like he has some sort of downs.
2018-08-01 01:07:29 Das Ubergeigh
2018-08-01 01:10:18 Just like a lot of people said, that scene with all the computers psychically exploding was missing venom CHI physically doing the deed.
2018-08-01 01:10:20 Ah nice, it's basically The Darkness in movie form.
2018-08-01 01:11:10 Admittedly it looks a bit less awful than the first couple trailers. But I still bet this movie ends up being the real turd in the wind. 
2018-08-01 01:12:29 Wow. This looks stupid. I'm reminded of the Spawn movie. 
2018-08-01 01:12:32 Great, another movie where I struggle to understand what he is saying
2018-08-01 01:15:13 They’ve taken a very Prototype/Prototype 2 approach to his transformability. And I like it.
2018-08-01 01:17:37 I'm excited personally. 
2018-08-01 01:18:13 Much better trailer, still looks mediocre though. 
2018-08-01 01:18:15 Is there anything Sony can’t screw up?
2018-08-01 01:19:04 I honestly forgot about this movie
2018-08-01 01:20:08 This trailer for the trailer shit needs to stop.
2018-08-01 01:21:48 It’s fascinating how many lines were cut together in this trailer. It’s like every 3 words they are cutting to a different dialogue 
2018-08-01 01:22:18 The accent Tom Hardy has for this really makes Eddie sound dumb. Not sure if that's what they're really going for, or if that's what Eddie is like in the comics. It's mildly  endearing.
2018-08-01 01:24:28 I’m just glad they got the Arby’s guy to voice venom. They should dub over Hardy’s voice with Topher Grace. That would be entertaining.
2018-08-01 01:27:24 What, no closed captions? I feel like they might be necessary for the parts with Venom speaking, at the very least. But anyways, this still looks dumb as shit and will thus prob make a good "recovering after the exam week" rent.
2018-08-01 01:27:52 This looks Justice League level bad 
2018-08-01 01:31:12 I want to trust Hardy I really do but... this movie has a lot of potential to be really bad
2018-08-01 01:32:08 Topher isn't Brock?  I really liked his acting...
2018-08-01 01:34:10 Fuck......
2018-08-01 01:34:41 Is this rated R? Please tell me its rated R.
2018-08-01 01:45:20 Kinda looks like an early 00's comic book movie. Hopefully it's entertaining 
2018-08-01 01:48:00 I like the look, sound and feel. I want to watch this film.
2018-08-01 01:51:05 Looks much better than the first trailer, can't wait.
2018-08-01 01:52:27 Oh look, the whole movie embedded in trailer again, including the climatic battle where the bad guy who gets the good guys power fights him...
2018-08-01 01:55:35 Its a good thing they got Tom Hardy, because he's the *only* reason I have any hope for this movie.
2018-08-01 01:56:12 I like the look of it; I've always been a fan of the symbiote morphing into weird shapes to fit the situation (e.g., it becoming a big shield). I'm not sure I like the approach of having the symbiote controlling Eddie. I've always liked them as partners. I also don't know about the cannibalism thing...is that in the comics?
2018-08-01 01:57:31 This movie should have been r rated considering it's eating people.
2018-08-01 01:57:44 Why is Tom Hardy talking like a baby in this? It’s so fucking funny 
2018-08-01 01:57:51 Man I've never had a movie that is so unpredictable. This is either going to be absolute garbage or really awesome. I sure hope for the latter. 
2018-08-01 01:57:53 fuck yeah!
2018-08-01 01:58:01 Not complaining, but I'm pondering who else could have been the voice for Venom instead of Hardy himself. Like Djimon Hounsou or Serkis.
2018-08-01 01:59:41 I'm honestly a bit surprised how easy it is to win people over with a trailer.  That first one was literally dog shit, and while this is better, I'm not sold on this being a good movie. 
2018-08-01 01:59:58 I finally realised who does venom sound like! 

Abathur from Starcraft 2 zerg expansion! 

https://youtu.be/uVOBLTS0lJc

2018-08-01 02:02:11 New Jurassic Park made a billion dollars. I wouldn’t be surprised if this does fine or flops. The nostalgia train seems to make erratic stops and there no rhyme or reason to when people get of or off.
2018-08-01 02:02:13 How can there be a be venom movie without spidey?!!
2018-08-01 02:02:20 General feeling among Venom fans on this?

To me it seems like such a big departure from the character I'm familiar with as to not be that recognizable. So it might be good but it doesn't feel like Venom so that's a pity. Might as well just make a new thing at that point. However I haven't followed the character that closely over the years so I'm willing to be wrong.
2018-08-01 02:04:08 It's like he wants to eat everything but spleens
2018-08-01 02:04:47 I hate it when trailers put what is obviously the final fight in the trailers.
2018-08-01 02:05:45 60% of these comments - haha omg I can't understand Tom hardy, let's all make the same joke for meaningless karma!

20% of these comments - did he just say that? Really? 
 
10% - This is soooo predictable, #third act is a gooey mess

10% - hey, this actually looks good. I might see this
2018-08-01 02:06:47 So who kills this cat? Or is it just a two hour version of ‘Man In The Mirror’? 
2018-08-01 02:07:15 WTF....3 minutes and 14 seconds. Just give it up with these trailers. Release a 25 second clip. Good enough.
2018-08-01 02:08:38 Hard to believe Tom Hardy is making that voice, not the venom one but the normal guy voice.
2018-08-01 02:09:25 Am I the only one who keeps hearing Tommy Wiseau whenever Eddie Brock speaks?
2018-08-01 02:10:19 At least Venom looks cool. Movie will probably still be ass
2018-08-01 02:10:25 So all those shots such as in that huge computer room when the workers go flying and when Brock gets pushed against the wall simply had no choice when they showed them off in the previous trailers? Why TF did they include them 
2018-08-01 02:10:43 I really thought this was called Venmo for a second
2018-08-01 02:10:48 Bane got an upgrade 
2018-08-01 02:12:05 Oh fuck!!!! WET!
2018-08-01 02:12:41 CGI looks cheap, expect nothing out of the movie.
2018-08-01 02:13:28 Looks fake 
2018-08-01 02:13:42 Meh 
2018-08-01 02:14:17 Even though I don't know what to make of it, I'm still going to go see it. 
2018-08-01 02:16:41 What is the last line Brock says? I can’t understand it
2018-08-01 02:17:01 Sony just stop making superhero movies, just give it all back to marvel 
2018-08-01 02:17:40 Prototype: The Movie
2018-08-01 02:19:45 I’m still not sold, even though I really want to be. 
2018-08-01 02:20:37 Venom resembles a RaV 4. Plastic. A put on. The original Spawn looked better then this. I thought venom was a symbiote. I’ll see it and the good news is I’m going in with low expectations.
2018-08-01 02:21:20 Better be better than the energy drink,  sleep drink.... 
2018-08-01 02:21:30 I see just about every movie, but I think I’m taking a stand here. This trailer makes it look better, but it shouldn’t happen at all. Stop being greedy shits, Sony. 
2018-08-01 02:26:21 This has a very DC film feel to it, and not like The Dark Knight, more like Batman Vs Superman. Doesn't feel like a Marvel film at all. 
2018-08-01 02:27:36 Fuck you sony 
2018-08-01 02:30:57 Spawn 2 is looking great. 
2018-08-01 02:30:58 wow this Upgrade remake looks lit
2018-08-01 02:33:00 I would’ve preferred parasyte: the maxim live action tbh
2018-08-01 02:33:45 Venom is what you get when you get bit by a radioactive killer whale
2018-08-01 02:39:02 The trailer showed a bit too much i think. I'm very hyped though 
2018-08-01 02:40:36 Did I or did I not see Carnage at 2:18?
2018-08-01 02:41:09 Venom sounds a lot like Daniel Plainview from There Will Be Blood! One line is even delivered with strikingly similar intonation.   


Seriously, listen to the last line "we will eat both of your arms and then both of your legs" and then listen to Daniel Day-Lewis deliver the line "I'm going to come to you inside of your house wherever you're sleeping".   
From 2:50: [https://youtu.be/UdddIJd3bLc?t=170](https://youtu.be/UdddIJd3bLc?t=170)
2018-08-01 02:41:49 is Venom a villain, hero or  anti hero?
2018-08-01 02:43:39 I'm also getting mega James Earl Jones vibes from the Venom voice. Particularly him reading The Raven on The Simpsons.
2018-08-01 02:45:17 Get ready for the cgi gasoline fest!
2018-08-01 02:45:40 Sudden random shot of Glasgow? Why Glasgow. 
2018-08-01 02:54:17 It looks cool... but not go-to-the-movie-theatre cool.
2018-08-01 02:54:35 Is that Carnage in there? The creepy looking dude with long, stringy hair? I'm really hoping that it is. 
2018-08-01 02:56:18 So is this an MCU movie or not? Because Sony is claiming it's set in the same universe as Spider-Man Homecoming, but the odds of either film acknowledging the other are slim to none.
2018-08-01 02:57:19 I had to replay the venom lines like 5 times to understand what he was saying. Then the end I had no idea what Tom Hardy was saying
2018-08-01 03:00:14 I’m sold; looks entertaining.
2018-08-01 03:02:48 Tom hardy kinda sounded like Christopher walken in some of the scenes.
2018-08-01 03:04:06 I wonder what the chances are of us seeing mcu spidey cameo in this? 
2018-08-01 03:07:14 Dang, in SF too? So many superheroes coming into my home city.
2018-08-01 03:11:06 Guarantee they put the final scene of the movie in the trailer. That ending clip was the ending with it cutting to the credits when he goes for the kill. The follow up scene is from a different point in the movie. 

2018-08-01 03:34:56 I thought the teaser and the 1st trailer were awful, but this one looks pretty cool. I'm going to see it now.
2018-08-01 03:36:36 Not sure how I feel about Venom's voice... had to replay some scenes to understand what it was saying. Will definitely give it a watch because I'm a Tom Hardy fan. 
2018-08-01 03:38:43 It's nice to see no one is complaining there's no spider on his chest.........not complaining yet
2018-08-01 03:47:35 i really hope this movie does well and we get a spiderman/venom movie. also damn i could barely understand venom, good thing i watch movies with subtitles on
2018-08-01 03:48:58 This is the only good visually looking venom. I'm going to really struggle without Spidey being tied to all of it.
2018-08-01 03:49:57 cgi looks terrible and after saw this trailer my expectation is very low right now. im not really excited anymore 
2018-08-01 03:52:19 So did Woody Harrelson get recast or what happened?
2018-08-01 03:55:32 This movie looks fuckin awesome I can't wait to see it 
2018-08-01 04:20:23 is this yet to be confirmed that this is in the mcu or is not in the universe at all
2018-08-01 04:31:18  Didn’t see one guess that maybe Eddie Brock is doing that baby voice line on purpose, maybe to mock someone? Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case ....
2018-08-01 04:33:58 Always go with the ANTI-HEROO or the VILLAIN so, I love this already
2018-08-01 04:34:01 please be good please be good please be good please be good.
2018-08-01 04:50:13 Good to hear Dr. Klaw is still getting work. 
2018-08-01 04:51:45 I bet this movie will end up sub 50 on rotten tomatoes. 

Any takers?
2018-08-01 04:52:58 Good night mrs Chen!
2018-08-01 04:53:50 Jesus Christ this movie is going to be sick! I love the dark humor!
2018-08-01 05:01:57 Can’t wait!
2018-08-01 05:06:53 Great thanks for spoiling the main villain also gets his own symbiotic suite for the final battle. I'm done with trailers
2018-08-01 05:10:23 Anyone else not loving the trailer? Didn’t have high hopes for SpiderMan Homecoming after the trailer but that movie blew me away!
2018-08-01 05:37:23 Looks a little gimmicky. The voicing and floating head etc seems to comedic to be scary.
2018-08-01 05:45:50 #WeAreVenom 

October can't come soon enough!
2018-08-01 05:46:33 This trailer had it's own trailer at the beginning.
2018-08-01 05:50:57 Rated R ?    Does anybody know ? Gotta be right?
2018-08-01 06:08:21 I wish this was MA.

I know that limits the size of your audience. But some swearing and a bit more gore (without being an over the top gore fest) would really suit Venom
2018-08-01 06:09:59 @ 2:40 he looks like Ryuk.
2018-08-01 06:11:54 I wasn’t expecting it to be an Oscar quality movie. I just think Venom is cool. 
2018-08-01 06:14:47 Needs more Spider-Man!
2018-08-01 06:16:06 I changed my mind. This looks pretty decent. They managed to nail Venom's mannerisms and cheesy creepy jokes, which they completely forgot about in Spider-Man 3. At least he wants to eat everyone again. 
2018-08-01 06:45:27 I hope they clean up Venom's dialogue a bit.  That reverberation makes it hard to understand in parts.
2018-08-01 06:51:04 They need to mix his eddie brock voice with his venom voice at the same time. Sounds weird as just one deep guttural voice. 
2018-08-01 07:02:41 "I'm a reporter" Sounds nothing and looks nothing like a reporter.
2018-08-01 07:05:12 “Guys you don’t want to do that, twust me”.  

I love Tom Hardy, I have a crush on Tom Hardy, but what was that?  This movie looks as bad as the line at the end about the turd, in fact this looks like a turd rolling down the street with the wind.
2018-08-01 07:12:57 Is this going to be rated R?
2018-08-01 07:24:53 Movie still looks awesome, effects look great. They are definitely putting an emphasis on Venom liking to eat people which is kind of surprising.

I don't think the trailer should have given away that Riz Ahmed eventually bonds with a symbiote though. They should have saved that for the movie.
2018-08-01 07:30:31 Holy shit Tom Hardy is the perfect super-villain. But who will be the one to stop him!?
2018-08-01 07:31:33 From what I’ve seen so far, I’m actually hoping this movie is good.

2018-08-01 07:51:30 The more they show me, the less interest I have in watching this.
2018-08-01 08:03:04 Is it just me, or does the monologue in this sound like it was taken from other sentences of dialogue a few words at a time? Or is that just his voice for Eddie?
2018-08-01 08:12:20 After seeing nothing but kid movies the whole summer with my daughters it’s refreshing to see some head chomping action.
2018-08-01 08:19:37 That thing is fucking terrifying
2018-08-01 08:38:23 this looks about as good as you can make a Venom movie
2018-08-01 08:45:33 sweet fucking jesus christ does this look amazing 
2018-08-01 08:53:50 I feel this is gonna be hot garbage 
2018-08-01 09:59:21 Night miss Chen 
2018-08-01 10:22:39 Wicked cool!!!
2018-08-01 10:45:28 Is it just me or the CGI looks really bad in some places.
2018-08-01 10:46:40 Another trailer that gives away the movie.  God damnit Hollywood.
2018-08-01 10:59:48 I’m gonna hold off expectations on this one. Not sure how I feel about Tom Hardy’s voice 
2018-08-01 11:35:24 At the end is he 

Eating that guy?
2018-08-01 12:09:15 Yeah gonna wait for the DVD to see this one in subtitles lol.
2018-08-01 12:27:21 looks pretty bad but still kinda want to watch it heh
2018-08-01 12:28:55 damn, why did he have to kill that guy at the end. :(
2018-08-01 13:04:08 Dude there are really many superhero movies releasing nowadays
2018-08-01 14:14:41 I feel like this is a movie that is begging for an R rating. 
2018-08-01 14:37:04 Think there will be a set up to Agent Venom movies down the line with Eddie Brock instead of Flash Thompson?
2018-08-01 15:21:23 That looks like Anti-Venom he’s fighting with
2018-08-01 17:28:47  **I'm glad they showed so much of the movie… But they showed so much of the movie.**

 I now understand Venom's motivations unfortunately I wish I could've found that out during the movie.

2018-08-01 18:04:42 Cant wait to see it :)
2018-08-01 18:13:24 I'm not sure what it is but it's just not grabbing me.  I mean, it looks kind of cool but there's something missing that not making me think "I NEED TO SEE THIS OPENING WEEKEND!!" like I do with Marvel films in the MCU.

It looks entertaining. I'll probably go see it before it leaves theaters...I think.
2018-08-01 18:30:40 Christ dude imagine Hardy with Bane training as the true world class body builder Eddie Brock in the MCU with the classic Spidey Venom suit. 
2018-08-01 18:40:34 Looks like they finished the CGI in that weird seizure scene, at least.
2018-08-01 19:01:44 “This power, it’s not totally awful.”

*eats two people*
2018-08-01 19:17:23 THIS should have been the only trailer made. The difference between this and that last trailer is.... Just huge!

If that other trailer didn't make me super skeptical about this film... I'd be hyped for this film. Ultimately, I think it'll be OK, but just recalling how awful some scrnes from the first trailer are... It'll probably still have issues.
2018-08-01 19:24:51 This will be bad

2018-08-01 19:37:10 Does does the whole mouth thing work with a symbiote? Like when his face splits open we can see Eddie's face as well, but on the Venom side, where does that tongue and throat and shit go?

Also, why are there so many symbiotes to kick this off?
2018-08-01 20:59:10 I know it would never happen, but how crazy would it be if Tom Holland showed up in a post-credits scene?
2018-08-01 22:26:59 Will Spiderman be involved in this?
2018-08-02 00:08:17 Will this movie be rated R? Judging by the trailer it looks like that’s what they’re going for but I don’t know.   The movie looks like the kind that would be ore enjoyable if it’s R.
2018-08-02 01:59:21 It's the second trailer and they still didn't give the "do we have a deal" line logical context.
2018-08-02 02:00:58 Bane looks unwell. But without Spider-Man, this thing looks off.
2018-08-02 04:38:48 Venom sounds like he's gargling phlegm.
2018-08-02 04:40:30 The green screen on Woody Harrelson at 1:37 looks awful.
2018-08-02 16:08:09 Eagerly waiting to see this movie. 
2018-08-03 15:11:20 All we are is turd in the wind.
2018-08-08 22:59:11 Holy cow that looks amazing!

 Hey everyone, check out my thoughts on the upcoming Venom movie. If you like what you see, please check out my other videos and subscribe to my channel! 

Thanks! 
2018-09-06 02:03:15 My expectations
65-78
2018-09-20 15:38:35 What the hell is that voice Hardy is putting on?
2018-09-25 22:50:42 I am booking my ticket this weekend with Sinemia. I can't risk not to catch it on the opening night. I am such a fan girl when it's Tom
2018-09-28 06:20:07 Anyone have a link to the symbiote powered home device commercial?
2018-10-04 15:46:49 Wish me a luck... I’m going to see this one 🤞🤞🤞
2018-10-05 07:08:58 I wish this had taken on a legit horror film. They could’ve done way more with an R rating to make a good standalone.
2018-10-07 03:04:51 From what I’ve seen not many people seemed to like it but I actually quite enjoyed it once it got going, the build up to give Eddie’s character felt 5/10 minutes too long which I think the time could’ve been used towards the change for Eddie/venom doing the heroic thing as that felt rushed and a bit out of character for what I was expecting, but overall it was a fun watch from a casual point of view so I’ll give it a 7/10 since if you don’t take it too seriously then it’s worth a rewatch in the future.

A couple of funny things I noticed the guy from the barber shop in luke cage has really moved up in the world owning his own news company now and the casual mentioning of kryptonite meaning DC comics exist in venoms universe.

2018-10-20 14:43:13 what a trailer i think it is best also check awesome spoof of Venom [click here](https://www.daybydaycollection.com)
2018-08-01 07:33:13 I’ll start off by saying this, how many movies has Sony ever produced that were amazing? Second, the CGI really doesn’t look good. Like that’s not even an opinion, some of those motorcycle scenes from the first trailer looks SUPER low budget. The humor at the end fell flat, and the character model for Venom just looks off to me. Tom Hardy’s New York accent makes me cringe, and Riz Ahmed isn’t a very good bad guy IMO. This doesn’t look good. I hope it’s good, but it will bomb... trust me. 
2018-07-31 17:19:59 Venom looks really good but I'm not too hot on Tom Hardy's Hedwig voice.
2018-07-31 17:34:31 Okay, I get that they don't want to cover up their big name Actor Tom Hardy but Venom doesn't just make your eyes black and then disappear into your butthole only to pop out tendrils when bad guys are near...

2018-07-31 17:47:24 Am I the only one or anyone else is having trouble in understanding what venom is saying?
2018-07-31 17:49:26 "I'm Eddie Brock, a reporter."

No. You're trash, Brock.
2018-07-31 18:18:02 This movie looks like an armless, legless, headless turd rolling down the street
2018-07-31 18:30:13 I'm baffled at how excited people are for this in the YouTube comments lol
2018-07-31 18:45:00 [deleted]
2018-07-31 19:28:59 This is going to be so awful. 
2018-07-31 19:37:29 This looks like utter shit.
2018-07-31 20:13:25 It’s time for the rest of the world to find out what comic fans and writers have known for 30 years:  Venom sucks and is nothing beyond a cool visual.
2018-07-31 21:36:12 this movie is gonna suck calling it now. and I'm a huge venom fan too. 
2018-07-31 21:38:08 Sony is fucking ruining Marvel. This looks atrocious. 
2018-07-31 22:31:17 Well this looks like garbage.
2018-07-31 22:37:25 *sigh* I tried to hold out. I wanted to like this, but it just looks too generic and stupid. they are obviously just riding on the hype that they figured Venom could bring. Maybe it's a case of bad trailer editing, but I doubt that.
2018-07-31 22:38:50 I know I'm late, and no one will see this comment, but there's something really really weird going on with this film. There must be a a license issue, or a contractual agreement that Tom Hardy has to fulfil, because this isn't a real film project. Starting with that really fucking weird reveal trailer, seemingly made only for brazil, with repeated clips of a fake crowd, and a fake film set:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVbqjIuZgIk

Both trailers have been really bad, and show poor quality footage, inconsistent and dull grading, underwhelming action scenes with poor coverage and really really bad writing. I genuinely think this film has been made for non english speaking territories. That fucking line "like a turd in the wind" cemented it for me. It's also cut like a trailer from 8 years ago? But badly? And it's 3 minutes long, it has a natural end at 2 minutes. "The best people" aren't working on any part of this project. Not to mention it's happening at the height of the success of the Marvel universe but isn't tied into any other marvel film including Spider Man. There's no A list actors except Tom Hardy, Riz is amazing, but looks trash in this, and Michelle Williams has 1 line in a 3 minute trailer? 
I don't know how to express this, but everything about this trailer feels off. I think something funky will come out surrounding this film at some point shortly before or after release. 
2018-07-31 22:49:53 The corporate bad guy will turn into Carnage for the final fight. Calling it now. 
2018-08-01 00:05:43 Am I the only person who didn't find this insanely hard to understand 
2018-08-01 01:03:55 I didn't really think Eddie/Venom were too difficult to understand, minus the very last thing he says after chomps that dude in the mini mart. "Oh... I have a power, to say? Night Mrs. Chang" was my guess. 

2018-08-01 06:33:49 Some of this negativity feels forced. Complaining for no other reason but to complain. And because it makes them feel like they're professional critics if they critique trailer dialogues. 

For example the line "Eyes, lungs, pancreas, so many snacks, so little time". That was pretty amusing. I thought it was great. Hoping there's more one liners talking about venom eating people. 

But Whoever thinks and said that's "such a bad line", can you explain why exactly it is other than just saying it is?
2018-08-01 06:35:11 This looks terrible
2018-08-01 06:41:56 This looks and sounds like a steaming pile of shit.
2018-08-01 10:07:53 The cg is absolute garbage. 
2018-07-31 17:19:24 I dunno about anything outside of it, but the Brock/Symbiote conversations and seeing Venom in action looks pretty cool.
2018-07-31 17:27:24 Lmao is eddie brock from boston or sth? what's with that accent 
2018-07-31 17:30:56 This was waaaay cooler than the first trailer.
2018-07-31 17:35:24 I feel like I just saw the whole movie.
2018-07-31 17:36:05 So the bad guy is just going to be the good guy but slightly different? Ugh. 

With all the fucking lore out there, they could have done better.
2018-07-31 17:36:18 There's no sign of carnage or spiderman 
2018-07-31 17:36:25 This was exactly the type of movie I would gamble on with moviepass, before it died this sad death. Now I have to again be selective with what I see. And since this looks like shit I'm giving it a hard pass. Sony truly is clueless on how to make a movie.
2018-07-31 17:37:58 F
2018-07-31 17:40:28 Has anyone noticed that we haven't seen Venom websling in any of the trailers. 

Is this another move to distance themselves from Spiderman? 

Also, was the other symbiote supposed to be Carnage? Why isn't he red?
2018-07-31 17:42:51 I know... let's make a movie about a Spider-Man villain without Spider-Man in it.


Brilliant!
2018-07-31 17:46:44 This looks cheesy yet  entertaining.

And they got Venom right, I think it will atleast be a fun one time watch. 
2018-07-31 17:47:19 I can’t stop watching it. It looks pretty amazing, apart from the CGI for some parts 
2018-07-31 17:47:25 Okay, but was that Anti-Venom at the end?
2018-07-31 17:51:26 To say that this does not instill confidence in me or bode well for the franchise and future of Venom the character is an understatement.
2018-07-31 17:52:43 No thanks, I'm good.

Also, is the evil business guy meant to be Carnage, and isn't Carnage meant to be red?
2018-07-31 17:55:40 Okay I’m kinda hyped I’ll admit it 
2018-07-31 17:58:52 This...doesn’t look good.
2018-07-31 18:04:27 Is that supposed to be Carnage at the end? Where's his trademark red?
2018-07-31 18:04:58 I thought a lot of the dialog was extremely cheesy and the "humor" doesn't fit at all.
2018-07-31 18:07:16 Haha he's fighting a bigger symbiote. They just couldn't resist it.
2018-07-31 18:09:06 I don’t know what’s worse, the dialogue or Tom Hardy’s accent. 

I’ll be there opening night. 
2018-07-31 18:09:31 Venom ain’t shit without Spider-Man.
2018-07-31 18:11:27 "Like a turd...in the wind"

The real tagline for this movie. Sheesh this looks awful. And I love Spider-Man. 
2018-07-31 18:11:35 Did people watch a different trailer or something? Was able to hear and understand everything being said.
2018-07-31 18:12:41 The one thing that got me interested was the double-axe-arms, but upon closer inspection, he doesn't hit a single person with them... just a bunch of monitors.
2018-07-31 18:19:42 Knowing moviepass is ending makes me all the sadder seeing all these movies come out.
2018-07-31 18:21:34 Now did Prototype (the game) take inspiration from Venom the comic book character or did Venom (the film) take inspiration from Prototype? because this could easily be a Prototype film from the looks of it.
2018-07-31 18:26:01 I commend Hardy for not being a primadonna like so many actors portraying characters with masks....but insisting their precious faces are visible at all times.
2018-07-31 18:28:21 I gotta say it, I LOATHE/HATE/DESPISE the little mini trailer with which most trailers begin with nowadays
2018-07-31 18:32:48 I don't get all of these comments. I understood everything fine.

Didn't even think twice about it.
2018-07-31 18:32:57 this looks like a fan made trailer using footage from a movie that never came out in 2009
2018-07-31 18:35:33 **What I liked:**

- CG is alweady better than in the first trailer and we still have 5 months to go. 

- Venom's design is awesome.

- I'm *really* excited for Riz Ahmed as a villain.

- That shot of half Eddie/Venom was reallh cool. Tom's dead stare really added to it.

**What I disliked:**

- Tom's accent is a very weird choice. It makes him sound a bit dim. 

I think the choppiness is just because it's cut together dialogue. Every trailer these days has that problem.

- Venom is a bit too...smooth and glossy. I wish his skin had a bit more texture to it. 

Texture always makes everything pop out a lot more making it  feel real. It's the same reason I dislike Tom Holland's Spidey   suit.


- The editing is really jarring.

Why does almost every trailer company feel like a weirdly fast and choppy trailer makes a better impression than an actual attempt to highlight one aspect of the movie really well?

Instead of jamming everyting in there give us one trailer that highlights the tone. Then one that highlights the story. And maybe one that highlights the action.

And please...use some music that's not been used 1500 times before.




- This doesn't look R-Rated. Why?

Wasn't the entire point of disconnecting this from the MCU to do something Feige wouldn't have the balls to do?

- And what's with the humour?

If this is going to to be an action comedy then it'll literally just be an MCU flick with a slightly darker colour pallette.

I was so excited to see a horror-esque take on the Symbiotes. The comic books that went there were amazing.

Seing that this won't be as dark as I hoped levels my excitement by quite a bit.

- The dialogue we've heard until now sounds really simplistic and dumbed down. Who exactly is it aimed at?

2018-07-31 18:36:08 Seeing Tom in a reporter role kinda weird
2018-07-31 18:36:49 Ohhh this looks so good!
I like that they look at the psychological aspect not just the physical.


What does he say before the line about "snacks?"
2018-07-31 18:37:04 Why does venom look like he's made of silly putty?
Still better than Raimiverse Venom. I hope this movie will plummet just so Sony will give the full rights to Disney.
2018-07-31 18:37:12 The cgi kinda reminds me of spawn!
2018-07-31 18:37:27 Who the hell wrote such crappy dialog? I will eat your face 
2018-07-31 18:37:44 This looks so bad 
2018-07-31 18:37:55 ITT: People need to get a hearing check. How can you not understand venom.
2018-07-31 18:37:59 Wait are people actually not understanding anyting theyre saying or is this a circlejerk?

English isnt even my first language and i understood everything they said, from Venom to Eddie 
2018-07-31 18:38:21 Looks like absolute dog shit.
2018-07-31 18:40:05 The day the superhero genre dies will be one worthy of much celebration. 
2018-07-31 18:40:30 Life is like a box of chocolates.
2018-07-31 18:40:54 This still looks laughably bad. The fucking dialog in this thing is atrocious! 
2018-07-31 18:45:15 Venom talks too much!
2018-07-31 18:45:42 This trailer threw right off the hype train I was riding on after the previous trailer. There are just way too many signs telling me that this might be Tom Hardy's worst performance since...wait what was his last bad performance? 
2018-07-31 18:52:37 I really hope this movie *flops*

Not because I don't like venom, but because I really want Sony to get that last little nudge towards relinquishing what should be Marvels franchise.
2018-07-31 18:55:21 The dialogue is awful, the story looks like a jumbled confused mess, and the accent Tom hardy is doing is horrible. However, the venom design is on point. They nailed that part. But I have a bad feeling this is going to be a huge train wreck other than that. Sony please just give marvel the rights for venom and carnage so we can get an actual good Spider-Man movie with venom in it.
2018-07-31 18:58:45 People are calling this a throwaway. People are saying it will flop

I don't care. 

I've been a fan of Venom since his first appearance (and hell, I loved Spidey's black suit from the first time I laid eyes on it).

*Spider-Man 3*'s treatment of Venom had me almost ready to leave the theater and I can't bring myself to watch it again thanks to that. It's like pop culture PTSD.

I cannot wait for this movie. I love Venom. I love Hardy.

My body is ready.
2018-07-31 18:59:11 Fingers crossed that it's bad enough to not do a sequel, and Sony has no choice but to hand Venom over to the MCU
2018-07-31 19:01:38 You'd think for a character that is entirely CGI they'd at least try to make the CGI look good. 

Nope. 

This looks bad.
2018-07-31 19:09:26 Well, I'm probably going to get downvoted.

But this movie looks fucking terrible.
2018-07-31 19:20:15 Wow, this trailer makes the movie look just as stupid as the first trailer did, if not more.
2018-07-31 19:25:24 This looks like the biggest trash since Fan4stic.
2018-07-31 19:25:36 this looks really terrible.....gonna be a hard pass from me. Bad dialogue, basically no villain, same old origin story rehashed over and over again. I'm a fan of tom hardy and super hero movies but no, just no
2018-07-31 19:29:00 I'm slowly losing all of the hope I had for this movie.
2018-07-31 19:29:15 This movie is going to be the real turd in the wind
2018-07-31 19:30:44 OK, now I have distinct feeling I have seen the whole movie and there is no reason to actually go to the cinema.
2018-07-31 19:31:03 Nothing I have seen so far makes me feel like this movie will be good. 
2018-07-31 19:33:04 This looks... Awful. Just terrible. I love Tom Hardy, but this performance seems DOA.
2018-07-31 19:33:41 Can’t wait for another third act that ends with the main character fighting on off-colored version of himself. 
2018-07-31 19:34:24 This is going to bomb so big. Do they even care how bad this movie is going to be?
2018-07-31 19:35:03 They might end up saying Riz Ahmed’s character is Carnage, but just make it red for the actual theatre release. If you google Carnage first thing that pops up is a Carnage ripping Eddie and Venom apart like in the trailer. Though, I feel like Sony sometimes handles Superhero movies like Bollywood does. Just slap on names and costumes that look similar and doesnt matter what the plot is. Might even break out into a dance number toward the end.
2018-07-31 19:35:10 Imagine being a redditor and enjoying these movies
2018-07-31 19:37:36 The writing does not seem to be good at all.
2018-07-31 19:37:36 I told my friends at school if this movie was good I would lick a school bus. I think I’m safe
2018-07-31 19:37:49 This is going to get really bad reviews but I think a good amount of the general public will like it 
2018-07-31 19:38:28 Dear Sony,

Your super hero, super villain, and anti hero movies suck.

Signed,

The World
2018-07-31 19:45:29 This will be such a shit movie
2018-07-31 19:47:49 Mannnn, the Marvel reboot of this in 8 to 10 years is gonna be awesome!
2018-07-31 19:48:58 2002 called. It wants its movie back.
2018-07-31 19:52:29 Is it just me or does the cgi (venom) look godawful? 
2018-07-31 19:57:59 My eyes hurt because of that CGI
2018-07-31 19:58:44 Looks and sounds terrible... sadly.
2018-07-31 19:58:53 The dialogue is terrible

Also my guess is the plot is he needs to go defeat the other symbiotes after some sort of jailbreak and collect their space gunk and he'll power up each time

The dual scythe move is probably near the end after gathering a bunch
2018-07-31 20:01:04 Why does Eddie Brock talk like he has a 6th grade reading level?
2018-07-31 20:01:11 Its CGI is not yet polished, I hope they get to that soon.
2018-07-31 20:01:39 Hey..  this one actually looks good!
2018-07-31 20:01:59 This actually looks like a not that awful movie... giant upgrade from the first trailer... still not going to see it
2018-07-31 20:03:14 What's up with the boring overused "all for the sake of progress" evil science guy? Hasn't that cliche oversaturated the genre yet?
2018-07-31 20:10:48 If it's not about Spiderman at all, why do I care? Totally lost me now that it doesn't look like it's even Spidey adjacent.
2018-07-31 20:15:01 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what Venom is trying to say?
2018-07-31 20:15:17 You know, I couldn't put my finger on it, but Venom just doesn't quite look like Venom without the hard Striping of the White Spider Design. I'm not a huge fan of the White "veins" ( and I know the deal, the spider chest emblem is because of spider-man) 
2018-07-31 20:16:56 Venom looks cool, but wow is the dialogue bad.
2018-07-31 20:40:57 these fucking retards showed the last "boss" in the movie, seriously, FUCK YOU. Heavy spoilers in this trailer.
2018-07-31 20:42:36 Who wrote this godawful dialogue. Don't release it like this. 

A turd in the wind...
2018-07-31 20:44:33 Am I the only person here more excited for the movie after seeing this trailer?
2018-07-31 21:39:19 This looks bad. 
2018-07-31 22:24:04 This is almost definitely going to be garbage
2018-07-31 22:27:01 Will have to wait for DVD and subtitles
2018-07-31 22:27:16 Wow Reddit hates this movie. 
2018-07-31 22:29:40 The dialogue is physically painful. Venom himself looks good though.
2018-07-31 22:30:03 Significantly better than the first trailer. Still wary, but if the reviews are moderate to good I'll see it in the theater for sure. 
2018-07-31 22:31:00 Nit so sure about this one.... gotta feeling it's going to be pretty boring
2018-07-31 22:32:24 This looks awful. Is venom gonna growl like that the whole movie? 
2018-07-31 22:37:26 If only this Venom was around when Toby MaGuire was Spider-Man 
2018-07-31 22:46:32 Doesn't look like it is gonna work for me without the connection to Spiderman.
2018-07-31 23:04:15 I never thought I'd say this but after that trailer I really hope Eddie has way more dialog than Venom. Eddie sounds awesome, venom is edgycringey as hell...
2018-07-31 23:07:56 Why does Tom Hardy mumble so much in every movie. I cannot understand a damn word he's saying.
2018-07-31 23:24:16 Eh, looks bad but also looks fun. 
2018-07-31 23:29:12 yawn
2018-07-31 23:53:45 I hate it when a trailer shows off what the finall boss will be, what the challenges will be. It's already basically summed up the film. I feel like trailers should tease, not spoil >.>
2018-08-01 00:05:37 Definitely looks better than Aquaman and Shazam.
2018-08-01 00:23:53 Was that a trailer for the trailer before the actual trailer?
2018-08-01 00:28:02 This is going to Sony's Suicide Squad. 

The entire time we're all going to be thinking "why isn't Spiderman dealing with this?"
2018-08-01 00:53:16 Still looks like absolute shit, probably won't bother watching it unless it gets some good credible reviews-
2018-08-01 01:09:11 Why does the cgi look like its from the early 2000s?
2018-08-01 01:10:09 Is this already a $5 dvd? 
2018-08-01 01:13:24 In don't care what y'all say, I think it looks fucking awesome. The "eyes, lungs, pancreas. So many snacks so little time" I thought was a badass line. Same with what he was saying to the Asian dude and eating his body parts. 
2018-08-01 02:34:57 Tom hardy speaking intelligibly freaks me the fuck out 
2018-08-01 02:57:15 This isn't looking so good. Hopefully it's just the trailers and the finished product turns out ok.
2018-08-01 03:52:29 This looks fucking terrible 
2018-08-01 07:59:13 Cool, I just watched the whole movie in less than 2 minutes. Can’t wait for the next one. 
2018-08-01 08:26:35 Can someone teach tom hardy to speak please
2018-08-01 08:39:46 Where does the host's human head go when Venom opens his mouth? :/
2018-08-01 09:40:09 Hey look, they found a way to make it look even worse!
2018-08-01 09:50:41 I don't like how they showed the host of the bigger symbiote. Fucking trailers show way too much. It should be illegal to show anything past act 2.
2018-08-01 10:11:33 Looks awful
2018-08-01 15:36:00 i still don't understand sony's hard on for this shit.
2018-08-01 16:21:18 Night Mrs Chen

I really liked the trailer! Can’t wait to see it
2018-08-01 16:37:27 The potential for hilariously bad dialogue is going to get me to see this.
2018-08-01 18:08:43 Looks so good..... till he fully turns. That venom head looks like garbage. The cgi is so obviously cgi that it just pulls me right out of the movie.
2018-08-01 02:53:26 How the the fuck do you have a Venom origin story without Spider-Man?  
Can somebody please explain this?  
2018-08-01 03:03:45 Anyone noticing how awful this looks yet?  Or is it going to remain a "Hardy is Venom omg!" hypefest?  
2018-07-31 17:29:16 This just looks so much like a studio wanting to do Marvel (and specifically Guardians). 

"It has all the typical Marvel things in it! Humor! Popular actors! Easter-eggs! EVEN THE MARVEL LOGO. That is how we break records on opening weekend! good job everyone."
2018-07-31 17:13:37 [deleted]
2018-07-31 19:59:25 I just feel like these movies are all made impulsively. Like they have two or three years, and zero ideas, to provide a product from scratch, so they just *go for it* and when they realize they've got nothing they have no choice but to try and package up the nothing into something presentable.
2018-07-31 21:32:45 [deleted]
2018-08-01 09:43:27 Anyone else think this is gonna do poorly based on this shit trailer presented here?
2018-07-31 17:14:28 No “give the rights back to Marvel” comments? Shocked.
2018-07-31 18:28:41 Man this looks bad..Looking forward to the reboot in 2 years
2018-07-31 22:39:14 I’m sorry, did Venom say “like a turd in the wind”?
2018-07-31 23:01:28 more superhero movies, hooray... 
2018-08-01 02:48:57 This movie won't be good
2018-08-01 04:18:28 looks terrible. just wait for bubblebee.
2018-07-31 17:27:02 I’m not so much impressed by the trailer but I’ll definitely get a ticket to watch it. The accent is so weird   Like he’s just whispering. 
2018-07-31 17:28:32 Even the person venom is speaking to will not understand what he is trying to say
2018-07-31 17:31:08 What is it with atom Hardyband intelligible super villains?
2018-07-31 17:34:23 Do you guys think spidey is gonna make an appearance?
2018-07-31 17:34:43 That's Lance Reddick as venom right?
2018-07-31 17:37:51 They could have made a movie on the prototype game series and it would been just fine.

Tom Hardy could have been a great casting choice on the Prototype game.
2018-07-31 17:38:26 Sony to Disney : 'The way i see it we can do whatever we want do we have a deal ? '
2018-07-31 17:38:43 I’m pretty excited.  Reminds me of the earlier marvel movies like The Punisher and Blade.  
2018-07-31 17:42:25 Hardy sounds like he's doing his performance from \*The Drop\* again - which incidentally is a great film, however it feels really weird hearing a similar accent with Eddie Brock, intrepid reporter.

I hope this will be good but my hopes aren't high.
2018-07-31 17:45:56 Sure glad I have MoviePass to see - ah shit.
2018-07-31 17:47:19 I really liked the last trailer but this one I didn't care for. It seems to be tonal inconsistent and some of the vfx looks pretty rough and we're only 2 months from release. However I can't understand venom in some scenes. It's like he has a demon stuck in his throat. Here's hoping this is all different in the film because I really want this movie to succeed
2018-07-31 17:48:14 I think this looks good! It reminds me of an early/mid 2000's superhero film. I know people like to shit on those, but I always thought they had a certain edgy, 'try-hard' charm. They're definitely doing the 'character' justice, at least. 

That being said, I do hope they clear up Venom's voice. I can live with some occasionally iffy visuals, but I don't want to be straining to hear what he's saying. 
2018-07-31 17:48:42 Pause at 2:18, is that carnage? 
2018-07-31 17:50:00 I loved every second of it. I don't understand why people are having trouble understand Vemon.  No his voice isn't smooth but I didn't have any issues. If you know a bit of vemon's lore and why he is the way he is the jokes are pretty much on spot for his character.(he first bonded with Deadpool)
2018-07-31 17:50:14 You know, I'm not expecting something fantastic out of this. I just hope it's mindless fun and has stupid action. That's all I'm looking for. 
2018-07-31 17:52:40 What is the budget for this? CGI seems at least 10 years out of date
2018-07-31 17:53:19 So most of the film has been given away in the trailer. Im gonna watch it and love it but can people stop ruining films with trailers now. do something creative.

E.G: Infinity war had a tonne of stuff not in the film that got me interested and 90 percent of the film was a surprise.

Jurassic world: FK : ruined the main twist and reveal of the final dinosaur in the trailer.
2018-07-31 17:56:45 Anyone else having a hard time picturing Tom Holland's Spiderman standing a chance against this iteration of Venom?
2018-07-31 17:57:21 I understood everything he was saying. Maybe yall need to listen to the audio on a TV or computer and not your phones 
2018-07-31 17:57:47 Looks very good although the trailer showed a bit too much for my liking. Glad to see Venom won’t be used sparingly, though.
2018-07-31 17:59:05 Spider-Man 3 gave me chronic diarrhea 
2018-07-31 18:01:08 Wow this looks fantastic !!!!!
2018-07-31 18:01:45 The writing is shit. I feel physical pain hearing Tom Hardy say these lines.
2018-07-31 18:03:00 The CG looks straight out of 2002. 
2018-07-31 18:05:33 T H I S  D O E S  N O T  L O OK  G O O D.
2018-07-31 18:06:49 This trailer is goddamn awful. I have a deep hatred of dialogue that is obviously spliced from a bunch of different scenes from the movie, which this is full of. The CG is also pretty bad, but that's nothing new. The writing seems laughable in a lot of areas, and we can barely understand venom OR Tom Hardy. This movie is probably gunna be really shitty, aside from the fights (hopefully). And i imagine its going to get 7-8/10 ratings despite all of this
2018-07-31 18:06:55 Holy shit this movie is going to suck.
2018-07-31 18:10:16 The visual effects in this look so bad
2018-07-31 18:10:36 Still looks like garbage!!!!
2018-07-31 18:11:14 I suppose we all knew how this was going to end up, anyway... But seeing the actual trailer makes me wonder just HOW these big studios decide to throw so much money at a horrible idea.  Unfortunately, this movie also teeters on that 'too scary to take my children to' territory, meaning the inevitable toy-line is going to suffer as well.  If their target was truly 30-year old men, they needed a bit more sophistication to the story.

To me, I just imagine this movie is going to be a symbiote-fueled romp, with the unsurprising, yet secretive reveal of Carnage at the end.  Depending on the box office numbers, however, that may never even pan out.
2018-07-31 18:13:11 man that cgi looks real choppy
2018-07-31 18:16:55 This looks genuinely awful. It's so bad it's legitimately hilarious.
2018-07-31 18:17:53 Ok, I'm confused... is the bad guy gonna be Anti-Venom? If I see a white Venom, I think Anti-Venom.
2018-07-31 18:18:19 I'll check it out when it's on Netflix.  The vagueness on whether this will at all be tied to Holland's Spiderman is very irritating.  If it isn't then it is completely pointless.
2018-07-31 18:18:58 This is going to be a disaster.
2018-07-31 18:20:46 Venom is my favorite comic book character

and oh man is this going to SUCK.
2018-07-31 18:21:22 Looked kind of dumb....  Was Tom Hardy's accent more Minnesota than new York to anyone else? 
2018-07-31 18:22:47 This looks...awful. It looks like shlock and not the good kind. Tom Hardy sounds like he doesn't even want to be there so he showed up one day drunk on set, made up a weird accent on the fly and they just went with it.   


Looks like shit.
2018-07-31 18:24:11 This looks very very bad.
2018-07-31 18:24:11 Wow, this movie keeps looking less shitty. I'm almost excited at this point!  


That yellow-ish symbiote, is that from the comics? I'm kinda wondering why they didn't just use Carnage. 
2018-07-31 18:25:23 Bane, now Venom, who  else will Tom Hardy play that we cannot understand? I literally did not understand anything Venom said ever. 
2018-07-31 18:25:34 Is this using a lot of unfinished CG?  The scene where they pull back and show venom's full body shot looked really bad.  He was just a shiny blob of black with some white veins running through and the tongue looked worse to me than in the original trailer.  
2018-07-31 18:26:48 "We are Venom" is a hell of a lot better than "We are the flash"
2018-07-31 18:28:40 At least it isn't Spider-Man 3. But this looks bad 
2018-07-31 18:29:21 I know drive by, simple comments aren't the best way to foster discussion, but ...

*Yikes*
2018-07-31 18:30:57 Nothing was difficult to understand. Wth
2018-07-31 18:31:41 ITT: People who somehow can't understand Tom Hardy and people who either don't know how Venom acts or have created false memories of the character.   

I do agree that the writing seems...strange. Hoping for the best with this one. 
2018-07-31 18:32:53 This movie better be Rated R or else it will flop.

Plus, I wonder if this will be canon to the MCU Spider-Man or canon to the Sony Spider-Man or if Spider-Man exist in this Venom's universe?

I can't wait to watch this movie. 
2018-07-31 18:35:16 Here before Marcel and DC fans , a true Spiderman fan.
2018-07-31 18:35:30 Ugh. The more I see, the worse it looks.
2018-07-31 18:36:57 Ok so the idea is that Venom is the antithesis of the current superhero trend, based on the tagline of "the world has enough superheroes". 

And yet, after he allegedly kills someone, Tom Hardy has yet another Marvel-esque light hearted quip. Sigh.

2018-07-31 18:37:13 This looks  like venom and the game prototype. Not that I’m complaining looks fun to watch
2018-07-31 18:42:05 terrible cgi
2018-07-31 18:49:19 Mehhhhh
2018-07-31 18:49:59 Each trailer feels worse than the last. This just looks like a generic cash grab 
2018-07-31 18:52:30 Some hate that it is "over the top" or "just silly". IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE, yes it is not like the Avengers. Even though it is "dark", it is sticking to what Venom does, which is just crazy sh!t. The arms flopping around, stopping bullets, etc. I know everyone hated the last trailer, I hope people appreciate this one more.
2018-07-31 18:52:47 Well it's definitely not a Marvel movie.
2018-07-31 18:54:01 Superhero films leave me cold but this looks particularly shit. Tom Hardy shouldn’t be doing this kind of stuff. 
2018-07-31 18:54:06 Millennials complaining that they can’t understand Hardy ironically understand all the lyrics to mumble raps.
2018-07-31 18:54:31 Superhero films leave me cold but this looks particularly shit. Tom Hardy shouldn’t be doing this kind of stuff. 
2018-07-31 18:55:06 CGI looks like shit. Sony butchering another series what's new
2018-07-31 18:56:02 I wish Sony would just give up
2018-07-31 18:57:26 Looks like pure shit bois.
2018-07-31 18:58:51 This looks like a steaming pile of shit
2018-07-31 18:59:34 Why do I get the feeling the sum total of when he will actually be fully Venom was shown entirely in this trailer?
2018-07-31 19:04:46 Did they just pull The Wolverine on us and watered down Carnage like what was done to Silver Samurai? Whether or not it’s actually Carnage, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a watered down Carnage with the wrong size and color. 
2018-07-31 19:05:19 That’s looks so terrible.  CGI shit fest. I also couldn’t understand a word Venom said in the entire trailer. 
2018-07-31 19:06:03 The new prototype movie looks good. Why does almost every single superhero movie need them to fight someone with the exact same power? Ironman, black panther, superman. 
2018-07-31 19:06:43 Yikes.. this looks bad. I can't wait.
2018-07-31 19:08:27 Yup. Still looks terrible.
2018-07-31 19:12:26 Looks meh.
2018-07-31 19:13:28 ITT:everyone saying the exact same fucking thing. Stfu already 
2018-07-31 19:18:55 ITT: "I can't understand a single thing Venom is saying, but isn't this line that Venom said really stupid?" 
2018-07-31 19:20:14 Trailer is 2 minutes too long.. All mystery is gone and I know the entire movie... Jesus Christ marvel...
2018-07-31 19:26:09 Honestly, I'm really hyped for this. Please just give us the Venom voice from the first trailer. That voice gave me the best goosebumps especially in the IMAX hall. 

Do we have a deallllll?
2018-07-31 19:28:42 Personally, I don't really care if this movie doesn't have anything to do with the main MCU. As long as it's a decent action movie I'll be happy.
2018-07-31 19:39:30 I'm sorry. i know people on here have told me that's they way Eddie is supposed to sound but he still sounds like he has down syndrome to me.
2018-07-31 19:55:13 atleast they're smart enough not to put the white spider on his chest.  They would've been crucified for that.
2018-07-31 19:57:54 Is venom gay ?
2018-07-31 19:58:15 Fuck Spider-Man 
2018-07-31 19:59:06 Not gonna lie , looks awful 
2018-07-31 19:59:49 This movie is gonna be terrible. 
2018-07-31 20:00:24 Better but it still looks really iffy. Is it just me or does Venom just not look right when he talks? Like he is just flapping his mouth? I couldn't quite tell if t was because of a bad edit or if it was bad animation.
2018-07-31 20:00:24 The writing/scrip in this just seems plain bad...and I unironically enjoy Mortal Kombat. Still on the fence about this, but I'm definitely leaning more to the "pass" side now.
2018-07-31 20:00:34 Hardy's accent wouldn't be so bad if he had decent lines. 

Everything he said in the trailer sounded like a child wrote it.
2018-07-31 20:09:47 [deleted]
2018-07-31 20:11:16 Damn you Sam Raimi for ruining my dream of seeing Venom and Spider-man in a good movie!
2018-07-31 20:16:39 Wish they hadn’t fucked with the symbiotes origin.

Even if they didn’t have the rights to Spider-Man they could have hinted around it was cane from a superhero suit.
2018-07-31 20:17:58 Looks shitteeyyy
2018-07-31 20:18:46 Kind of baffled at how Sony doesn't seem to have learned its lesson from trying to reboot the Spider-Man franchise.
2018-07-31 20:19:58 is that Anti-Venom? I can't really fucking tell by the cum looking bullshit.
2018-07-31 20:20:23 Yikes. Dumpster fire. 
2018-07-31 20:24:34 It’s like Logan if Logan had a terrible script, directing and budget
2018-07-31 20:24:37 This is gonna suck ass! Why is Hardy doing a Walken mpersonation?
2018-07-31 20:25:08 The voice is terrible. No spider on chest. Still no Spider-man. Dialogue is horrendous. 

I’ve been a Venom fan all my life. He was actually my favorite as a kid, even over Spider-man. But this...This isn’t a Venom movie. 

I’ll pirate it someday, I guess. 
2018-07-31 20:31:51 The cgi looks terrible.. Especially the face licking part 
2018-07-31 20:34:36 So is Eddie Brock retarded now?  I thought he was supposed to be a jock, not on the fucking spectrum.  This looks awful.  
2018-07-31 20:38:20 Well, don’t need to see that film now.
2018-07-31 20:39:58 Is it just me, or is Venom harder to understand as opposed to the first trailer?
2018-07-31 20:40:01 Okay so accent - bad. That face licking scene - bad. But giant ass arm scimitar is awesome 
2018-07-31 20:45:38 don't pay a dime to this crap fest. 

There is no carnage, woody is only in a post credit scene as cassidy to set up a sequel.

There will be no sequel, the rights are now going back to Marvel. 


2018-07-31 20:45:56 Welcome to the Snyder-verse, MCU fans!
2018-07-31 20:54:08 Still looks shit
2018-07-31 20:56:16 I'm sorry but what the hell is he saying at the end?

I heard it over 20 times now and I still don't understand...

"Oh fu- I have pair of sake, yeah... name is a Chan" ???
2018-07-31 20:57:35 I don't get the backlash from all you guys, I thought this was a huge difference from the first trailer and I'm sucked in to the hype. Nothing WRONG with eddies voice, he's a drunk and a self-defeatist. Venom looks amazing, and I understood what he said every time although I must me in the minority, but it was easy enough for me. CGI looks great and I like the shitty attempts at comedy from venom it's exactly what I expect from him
2018-07-31 21:11:17 Sony, I don’t feel so good
2018-07-31 21:13:36 Hey guys, there's a difference between corny and cringey. Venom in the comics is the former, turd in the fucking wind is the latter. Let's not pretend that just because people don't like that line that they have no experience with the source material. 

I do, and I expect corniness. But comic Venom wasn't cringey.
2018-07-31 21:23:49 Bet it would be meh
2018-07-31 21:27:49 Definitely looking forward to this movie :)
2018-07-31 21:36:58 And people said no one asked for Solo.
2018-07-31 21:37:35 What the hell? You think they would learn than disgusting levels of CGI that doesn't look good is a bad thing. Did nobody learn from Green Lantern? Don't animate the entire suit, go the route of Iron Man or something.

I was really excited for this movie, just because of the cast.. but this just ruins it.
2018-07-31 21:45:40 Attempt 2. Still looks shit. 
2018-07-31 21:50:23 Where are all those smart asses who said Venom will only appear at the very end?
2018-07-31 21:59:21 And here we go again with more capeshit. I can't wait for this to end. 
2018-07-31 22:06:19 This looks really good.   Tom Hardy playing Eddie Brock I thought was gonna be a problem, since he's so used to being "gritty" (Mad Max) and grounded in his films...but he pulls it off in voice and how he carries himself, its still hard to see Tom Hardy as this weakling Brock, but he seems to make it work.
2018-07-31 22:19:18 So his eyes consists of cum?
2018-07-31 22:20:36 This looks like they made a movie from the game prototype lol 
2018-07-31 22:20:38 It feels like a tech demo. 
2018-07-31 22:20:47 Still meh
2018-07-31 22:22:18 Anyone else just tired of all these comic book monies coming out? I enjoy them as much as the next guy but holy shit when is it going to stop 
2018-07-31 22:25:16 Sweet divine chorus line, this looks like shit.
2018-07-31 22:29:02 Why it seems that in two trailers I already got the plot of the movie. That's unfair Sony. 
2018-07-31 22:35:32 This looks so boring. The action isn't there to sell it to me, and neither is a compelling plot to tell me it's more than an action movie. "Staring down armed forces" and "night car chase" and "robber at a convenience store" are all the most boring ass set-pieces ever. And there's no villain shown to tell me there is something more interesting he'll do. 
2018-07-31 22:40:23 they should have just made a parasyte live action. 
2018-07-31 22:48:07 So it looks like the antagonist of the film is just another version of the protagonist. Yippee. 
2018-07-31 22:54:32 I'm not feeling this at all. Feels tacky like the new predator 
2018-07-31 22:57:22 This looks like garbage, this is probably the nail in the coffin for Sony's attempt at live action marvel property's.
2018-07-31 23:16:50 That dialogue at the end was cringey. This movie has a lot of potential, I hope the dialogue and story aren't  dumbed down excessively. Poop jokes have me concerned. 
2018-07-31 23:26:16 I can’t wait. That scared the shit outta me.
2018-07-31 23:31:51 Does anybody else feel like the Venom's face looks too cartoony, too directly from the comics? It doesn't look organic or alien, just CGI. It's like everything they usually try to get around when designing Spidey's mask.
2018-07-31 23:42:23 This looks really fucking awful right?
2018-07-31 23:46:25 Seriously, they should have introduced the venom symbiote during the avengers where at some point on one of the random planets Spiderman is in the background flicking something gross off his arm or whatever, then when he turns around and walks away he has a heap of black goo on his back, only noticeable if you're really watching.
2018-07-31 23:48:13 Saw the movie, now I don't need to pay.
2018-07-31 23:52:48 No more "Sim bye ote"!!!!!!

They're saying it properly!
2018-07-31 23:59:32 Jeez if I didn’t think Tom Hardy was hot enough...
2018-08-01 00:13:15 Looks like a good movie for Symbiote Man. For Venom though? Big Pass.
2018-08-01 00:14:14 Hollywood and guns pisses me off.  No one uses red dot lasers on their firearms, especially not snipers.  Why would you give away your position?  And suppressors?  Don't get me started, they don't literally make the gun silent.
2018-08-01 00:21:53 does anyone know if carnage is going to make an appearance?
2018-08-01 00:24:47 God-another movie where the Villain is trying to "CHANGE THE WORLD" because "HUMANZ ARE EBIL!!"


Remember "the power of the sun in the palm of my hand"? 


Saw it in Spiderman 2, saw it in Iron Man, saw it in god knows how many other superhero films.......
2018-08-01 00:29:47 ITT- people who need fucking hearing aids.
2018-08-01 00:58:52 I couldn't finish the trailer. I'm so sick of hero movies
2018-08-01 01:26:17 Is Tom Hardy ever going to make a film where we can see his face throughout the film?
2018-08-01 01:39:55 This looks fucking terrible, why is this getting so much positive feedback? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here...
2018-08-01 01:40:29 I hate superhero films, but this looks fucking boss. 
2018-08-01 01:43:34 effects are horrible.
2018-08-01 01:53:47 Was.... was that.. a trailer before the trailer?
2018-08-01 02:13:15 This movie is going to be absolute butt ass.  Feels bad man.  I really really hope I'm wrong.
2018-08-01 02:20:40 No spider on the chest. Hmmm...is it really venom?
2018-08-01 02:32:47 This could REALLY rank up there for me, not because I’m a fanboy or anything. I’m not even a comic book guy in general. The movie just looks solid. My ONE hang up from these two trailer is buying that guy as a reporter and not a, let’s see, a college quarterback who tore his ACL and ruined his chance at the pros, and gets by teaching boxing or something. I won’t judge fully until I see the movie of course. Maybe the reporter part won’t matter so much.
2018-08-01 03:12:08 I have the power of what? Satan?
2018-08-01 03:38:06 Venom’s suits looks better than Tom Holland’s Spider-Man suit, @ at me.
2018-08-01 05:15:12 Why is this *Downvote* button even an option here?? 

Srsly?!
2018-08-01 06:13:48 Tom Hardy finally starring in a major American movie.
2018-08-01 07:55:17 It's late, but, off the top of my head, do any Modern Age (1985 and later) heroes or villains really knock it out of the park in movies?  I can't think of one.
2018-08-01 08:07:58 What does Eddie say at the end? "I have the power to save"?
2018-08-01 09:48:19 still clunky cgi, RIP
2018-08-01 11:10:56 Where’s Spider-Man?
2018-08-01 17:00:06 6.5/10 Imdb comin right up.
2018-08-01 23:26:30 This looks like it’s constructed with all the care and effort of a late 90’s superhero movie. 
2018-07-31 17:21:34 [deleted]
2018-07-31 17:25:01 Edgy and try-hard. 
2018-08-01 02:49:49 Movie is going to suck.  They have a great actor and a great character and it’s going to be dumb.  I know it.  
2018-08-01 02:53:41 I find it odd everyone is hating on this, the avengers was one of the worst movies ive ever seen, I guess its because not every character seems the same and its not all one liner jokes about a "rabbit". Fucking hive mind is real.
2018-07-31 20:18:01 [deleted]
2018-07-31 18:58:05 The venom design and voice are awesome, but it feels so wrong without the white spider 
2018-07-31 19:02:03 Dude if you're going dark and conflicted commit fully. Why marvelify it with fucking quips that arent even funny.
2018-07-31 19:03:48 Oh for fucks sake, another comic book movie where the antagonist is just the protagonist with all the same powers "but evil". Or evil-er this time, I guess.

Every time this happens it just reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaNWFHLy2NI).
2018-07-31 19:05:06 Oh shit, the villain is a bigger but slower Venom clone! That's really original.
2018-07-31 20:01:55 Hahaha wow this movie is gonna be terrible
2018-07-31 20:08:07 looks terrible, when will the superhero saturation end?! infinity war happened, end this 
2018-07-31 20:38:36 these lines are so cliche it's not funny
2018-07-31 20:39:23 This looks terrible 
2018-07-31 20:47:36 Can't wait. Don't care about Aquaman or Shazam, give Venom.
2018-07-31 20:58:49 It looks fine. Oh wait, it's not made by Marvel Studios?, I changed my mind it looks like shit.
2018-07-31 21:29:35 Why watch a trailer 2? It just shows more and spoils the movie.
2018-07-31 22:41:45 I feel like this is gonna be the like the recent Ninja Turtles movies. Get the title characters completely right, then fuck up everything else. 
2018-07-31 22:55:07 This is going to blow hard
2018-07-31 22:55:23 Venom looks like a big slimy turd in the wind. How does he eat people if Eddie is inside him?
2018-07-31 22:56:02 I like how the trailer is kind enough to write the bad review for everyone. 
2018-07-31 23:10:57 Oh no! There go my hopes. Thanks for sharing!

2018-07-31 23:39:42 The CGI is so awful lol Sony might be doing this movie to prove SM3 Venom wasn't that bad, and I thank them for it.
2018-07-31 23:58:16 It’s not a parasite, it s symbiote dammit!
2018-08-01 00:05:39 Before I watch this, is it still sym-BYE-ote?
2018-08-01 00:17:03 Please mark it as spoiler... I didnt mean to see that. Thanks. 
2018-08-01 01:52:44 I’d probably enjoy the animated spider mans venom in a full length movie than this seeing this bullshit
2018-08-01 02:37:45 Wow all of these superhero movies just make it seem like the writers strike was a fucking waste of time because they really do deserve their work conditions 
2018-08-01 04:19:11 I might be over comic movies. This looks like absolute dog shit to me

2018-08-01 17:09:11 Funny that Logan Marshall Green is in a movie with kind of the same concept but what appears to be better execution. The trailer for Upgrade looks like a guy who reluctantly allows for “something” to take over and has conversations with it and lets it do all the fighting. Upgrade however looked funny and entertaining, although I guess I haven’t seen either and solely basing this off both trailers.

2018-07-31 19:05:01 As someone who is sick of superhero movies and doesn’t even bother once they hit Netflix anymore, “the world has enough superheroes” got me. I’ll probably watch this. Tell me it’s rated R.
2018-07-31 19:36:57 Hope this movie is actually good so the MCU fanboys can get triggered even more than they already are.
2018-07-31 19:59:09 This just looks like a bad "Upgrade" knock-off
2018-07-31 20:00:32 This movie looks horrible. I just... 

Why Sony?????????????????????????????
2018-07-31 20:01:49 Not sure which looks worse, this or Aquaman
2018-07-31 20:34:15 The second he licked that dude’s face is the moment I realized that I think the film adaptations of comic movies have jumped the shark. Interest level plummeting. 
2018-07-31 21:42:50 It’s weird isn’t it? MCU fans hate this without having seen it, which proves they’re Disney fans and not Marvel fans.
2018-07-31 22:29:19 Be forewarned, this trailer is bloated with spoilers. Also, I simply could not understand what Venom was saying pretty much every time it spoke. 
2018-07-31 22:43:14 Why is Venom African American?
2018-07-31 22:56:33 Another trailer that essentially gives away the entire plot. 

I'll pass, not interested as much as I was 5 minutes ago. 
2018-07-31 23:05:35 So it's like a worse version of Upgrade?
2018-07-31 23:11:10 This show will suck. 
2018-08-01 01:08:05 Anything with Tom Hardy in it just seems to suck.
2018-08-01 02:44:41 This looks like shit. Way to ruin another childhood favourite character.
2018-07-31 17:44:40 I don’t give a fuck what anyone says. Venoms always been my favorite character and Tom hardy is awesome. It looks amazing and I just want awesome action and venom interactions. Stop taking this shit so serious everyone . It’s not topher grace 
2018-07-31 17:21:11 Go see the movie Upgrade if you haven't. I will still check this out, though.
2018-07-31 19:51:27 i hate this fucking trend of the mini trailer before the actual trailer, which is like 3 minutes long.

Also, stop. making. comic. book. movies.
2018-07-31 23:07:47 Looks awful. Tom Hardy sounds mentally fucking challenged.
2018-07-31 23:44:41 Looks terrible. Venom bad, Eddie Brock try be good, inner struggle, we get it.
2018-08-02 07:42:25 Same people who think this trailer is good, also think Shazam is ass
2018-07-31 18:28:44 This looks awesome and like they are doing Venom right 
2018-07-31 23:16:29 Venom is a shit character that makes emasculated men feel powerful.
2018-07-31 17:29:14 Was that Fucking Carnage??? 
2018-08-01 04:20:21 everyone one of these MCU and MCU connected superhero movies needs to die.
